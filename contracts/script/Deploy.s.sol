/// That is a dry run: it simulates against the chain the URL answers for and prints every transaction it

/// that, never an agent.
///
/// The second entry, `settings()`, writes the file's assets, routers, cash token and closed days into a
/// factory already deployed, as its admin (`FACTORY` names it):
///
///   FACTORY=<address> forge script script/Deploy.s.sol --sig "settings()" --rpc-url <url> --sender <admin>
///
/// It is how a test network's tokens, feeds and exchange are listed once they exist, after the deploy.
///
/// The deployer is the admin and the beacon's owner while the script runs, so that it can write the
/// settings. How it ends depends on the file:
///
///   - With a `timelock` (required on a mainnet): the script creates OpenZeppelin's `TimelockController`,
///     hands the factory's admin and the beacon to it, and finishes the hand-over itself, so the deployer
///     ends the run holding nothing. The timelock starts with no delay and the deployer as a second
///     proposer and executor, for one batch only: accept the admin, accept the beacon, set the delay, and
///     take the deployer's three roles away. After that batch the only proposer, canceller and executor is
///     the file's `timelock.owner` (a Safe), every admin call waits out the delay, and the script reads all
///     of it back and fails if anything is otherwise.
///   - With an `admin` and no timelock (a test network): it proposes that key for both. Until the key
///     accepts (`acceptAdmin()` on the factory, `acceptOwnership()` on the beacon), the deployer holds both.
///   - With `adminIsDeployer`: the deployer keeps both, as on a test network with one key.
///
/// The script does not call `launch()`.
///
/// On a mainnet (any chain id that is not a known test network) the file is held to the rules of
/// `checkMainnet` before anything is created: see there. `settings()` is refused on a mainnet: there the
/// settings are the timelock's to change, through the Safe.
