/// One person's vault for one plan on one chain. The logic contract behind every vault's beacon proxy.
///
/// The owner's path and creation (EVM-1, EVM-2): deposit the cash token, swap through an allowed router,
/// set targets, and withdraw in kind to the owner. The keeper's path (EVM-3): accept a version and switch
/// auto-follow (the owner), adopt a version (anyone, for a vault that follows), and the keeper's trade.
///
/// Rules that hold here and must keep holding:
/// - A vault is created by its factory and by nothing else: the proxy's constructor runs `initialize`, the
///   caller becomes the config, and `start` answers only that caller and only in the same transaction.
/// - Money comes in as the chain's cash token only (gate `DEPOSIT`). The vault reads which token that is
///   from its config each time. A token sent in from outside cannot be stopped: it is not in `tokens`, and
///   the owner takes it out with `withdraw`.
/// - Tokens leave only by the owner's call (I1): to the owner, or as the input of a swap the owner signed,
///   never more than its `amountIn`. No function takes a recipient, the owner is set once and cannot be
///   changed, and there is no `fallback` and no `receive`.
/// - A swap is judged by what the vault's own balances did, never by what the router answers: spent at
///   most `amountIn`, received at least `minOut`, no other token of the vault debited.
/// - No allowance from the vault outlives the swap that gave it, on the token or in Permit2 (I3). The vault
///   has no `isValidSignature`, so nobody can sign an allowance in its name.
/// - Withdrawing reads no feed and calls neither the config, the factory nor the registry (I4). Only a
///   beacon upgrade can block it. No pause reaches it: the guardian's two switches stop the keeper and new
///   deposits, and neither is read on the way out.
/// - New money is counted and capped (the deposit caps): the vault keeps what came in as cash less what
///   left as cash, tells the config that number inside each deposit, and the config refuses a deposit that
///   would pass the cap of one vault or of all of them. A withdrawal lowers the vault's own number and tells
///   nobody.
/// - `withdrawAll` never leaves a token behind for lack of gas: short of gas it fails as a whole.
/// - One reentrancy guard covers every function that changes state. `multicall` is the one exception: it
///   only calls back into the vault, and each inner call takes the guard itself.
/// - Amounts are raw token units. The vault never calls `decimals()`; the config states them.
/// - The keeper can call one function, `keeperSwap`, and the checks of section 5 bound what it can lose:
///   each trade at most the tolerance at the reference prices, a week at most the loss cap (twice it when
///   spread to follow the counter's drain), and only toward the targets the owner chose. Tokens never leave
///   by the keeper except as a trade's input. Nothing on the keeper's path is read by the owner's: a pause,
///   a dead feed or a closed market stops the keeper and never the owner.
/// - State lives in one ERC-7201 namespace. Later slots append to `VaultStorage`, never reorder it, and
///   inherit only bases that are stateless or namespaced.
