// The API the end-to-end spec of the web app runs against (apps/web/e2e): a stub over HTTP, on the

// The order routes are the SDK's own double of them (packages/sdk/test/api-double.ts) on a chain of
// packages/chain-mock, so the screen's executor builds, checks with the real guard, signs with the
// throwaway wallet and reports, step by step, as it would against apps/api. It is not apps/api: the
// throwaway wallet has no sign-in, and apps/api answers an order route only to one.
//
//   tsx tests/e2e/stub-api.ts            STUB_API_PORT (3901), WEB_ORIGIN (http://localhost:3100)

// Plans an agent proposes from a link are made and read back as the API does (AGT-2). Four routes of
// its own, for the spec: POST /__stub/reset forgets everything, POST /__stub/delay { ms } has every
// answer wait that long (the loading states), GET /__stub/reports
// lists the steps the web reported as signed, POST
// /__stub/tamper makes the next swap it builds carry a lower minimum than the order states, as a
// server that lies would, and POST /__stub/test-network has the funding answer as a test network's
// with test funds offered (POST /v1/testnet/fund), as a server with a faucet key does. MOCK throughout: every figure says so. The /risk routes are the one
// exception: they answer from Rodrigo's recording of the risk API (stub-risk.ts), measured and old.
//
// The portfolio section's four routes (GET /v1/portfolio/plans, /history, /rebalances, /exposure,
// PORT-3) answer whoever asks with the section's own sample answers
// (apps/web/features/portfolio-section/fixtures/answers.ts): seven vaults on two chains, one labelled a
// test network and one the mock, and Base switched off, so the spec sees every kind of card. They are

// not change them. Each is narrowed by `chain`, `address` and `limit` as the API narrows its own, and
