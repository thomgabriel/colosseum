//! The vault program: one vault per person per plan, on Solana.
//!
//! The owner path (create, deposit cash, swap through the one allowed router, set targets,
//! withdraw the tokens themselves), the platform's asset list, the shared-portfolio registry
//! with the author limits, the keeper's one trade with its checks, the owner's consent to a
//! new version, and the admin's and the guardian's switches.
//! The design is docs/vault/DESIGN-VAULT.md, sections 3.7, 5, 6 and 13.
