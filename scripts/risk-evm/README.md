# EVM depth collector

What it costs to sell (and buy) a stock token at a given size on an EVM chain, measured once an hour from the real pools. The rows feed the same exit-cost curves the Solana risk layer produces. Slot REVM-1; design in `docs/vault/DESIGN-VAULT.md` section 8.

It reads Robinhood Chain mainnet (chain 4663), whatever network the product itself runs on, because that is where the liquidity is. It only makes `eth_call` requests and public GETs: no transaction, no key, no wallet.

## What a run does

1. Reads the latest block and pins every later call to it. A token's prices and its quotes always come from one block; the row's `fetched_at` is that block's time and `slot` its number. All tokens of a run share the block unless it has to be replaced (see "When a block cannot be read").
2. Loads the pool list from `data/risk-evm/pools-<chain>.json`. If the file is missing, a day old, or `--rediscover` is passed, it asks DexScreener for each token's pairs against the dollar token and checks the candidates on chain. A v3-style pool is kept only if an allowlisted factory's own `getPool` returns it for that pair and fee (a contract can claim any factory, so the factory is asked). A Uniswap v4 pool is kept only if its key, from the PositionManager, has no hook. Those are the pools the vault's swap path reaches. The three deepest per token are kept. If DexScreener fails or comes back empty for a token that had pools, the old list stays.
3. Reads every pool's mid price in one Multicall3 call at the pinned block (`slot0` on v3 pools, `StateView.getSlot0` on v4). A pool more than 2% from the median of the token's pools is left out of that run.
4. Quotes each pool at Rodrigo's size grid ($100 to $5M, eight sizes), selling and buying:
   - v3-style pools: `ClQuoter.sol` in this folder, placed at a made-up address with an `eth_call` state override. It calls `swap` and reverts inside the callback, so it returns what the pool would take in and pay out without anything being deployed or paid.
   - v4 pools: the deployed v4 Quoter, all sizes in one Multicall3 call.
5. Per size, keeps the pool that loses the least, and appends one row per token to `data/risk-evm/assets/YYYY-MM-DD.jsonl`. If a pool's call fails for any reason other than gas (the endpoint refused it, no answer), the token gets no row from that attempt: a row without its deepest pool would show a thinner pool's cost as the best. `data/risk-evm/runs.jsonl` records each attempt (block, rows, calls made, duration, each token's error) and each scheduled hour (see "The run log").

## Method `evmq-0.1`

- A sale of size `n` sells `n / mid` tokens into a pool, where `mid` is that pool's own price at the same block. `outUsd` is the dollar tokens received (one dollar token counts as one dollar) and `costPct = (1 - outUsd / n) * 100`. A purchase spends `n` dollar tokens and values the tokens received at the pool's mid.
- The cost therefore includes the pool's fee as well as price impact. A 0.05% pool costs 0.05% at $100.
- The reference is the pool's price, not the Chainlink feed, because the feed can be hours old.
- Each point carries `pool` (the pool chosen), `midUsd` (the price it was measured against), `quoted` (how many pools gave a quote at that size) and `unfilledShare`. `outUsd` is null when no pool gave one.
- `ref_pool` and `ref_mid_usd` are the deepest pool in the run and its mid. `source` names the block, the chain and the RPC.

Known limits:

- **Best single pool overstates cost when liquidity is split.** A router that splits a sale across pools does better than any one of them. The gap grows with size.
- **Only pools the vault can reach are measured.** Other venues on Robinhood Chain quote stock tokens tighter than Uniswap does; an aggregator would use them, the vault's router does not. Which venues, with their pools and 28 days of volume each: `docs/risk/PLAN-UNIVERSE.md` section 6, "The venues we do not read (RU.13)", Table 5 (`pnpm risk:venues`).
- Pool prices of one token differ by up to about 0.3% (a 0.3% pool is not arbitraged inside its fee). Measuring each pool against its own mid is right on average and can be off by that much in one sample.
- A pool that runs out is treated differently by kind. A v3-style pool answers with a partial fill: the unfilled part counts as lost in `costPct` and shows in `unfilledShare`. The v4 Quoter refuses the size (`NotEnoughLiquidity`), so a v4 pool gives no quote there.
- The public RPCs cap `eth_call` at 50M gas. A size that walks a whole pool can exceed it; that pool is then missing at that size (`quoted` shows it). v3 quotes stop at 20M gas per swap, and a v4 batch that runs out of gas is asked again without its largest size, up to three times.
- DexScreener returns at most 30 pairs per token and its liquidity figure only ranks the candidates.

## When a block cannot be read

The public RPC keeps a block's state for a few minutes. On Oct 3, 2,000 blocks back (about 3 minutes) still answered and 10,000 did not. A run takes about ten seconds, so this only matters when something stops it part-way, and the overnight run of Oct 2 to 3 showed what does: the Mac slept during runs, which then took 16 to 94 minutes of wall time and found the state of their block gone.

- **The block's state is gone.** The endpoint answers `historical state … is not available`, `missing trie node … layer stale`, or names a block it does not have. The token being measured is started again on the latest block, prices first, then quotes; nothing read at the old block is kept for it. This is tried twice per token (`MAX_REPINS_PER_TOKEN`). Rows already written keep their block, and the tokens still to do move to the new one.
- **The run was paused.** Before each token the run checks how long it has held its block. Past two minutes (`MAX_PIN_AGE_MS` in `run.ts`) it takes a fresh block for everything that is left, rather than ask about state that is probably gone.
- **The pause ran into the next hour.** A fresh block is never taken once the next scheduled run is due, between tokens or for a token whose own block has just turned out to be gone. The run stops and leaves that token and the rest to the next run, so no token is sampled twice a minute apart and no row lands in the wrong hour. A quote that was on the wire during the pause and still comes back good is kept: it is a sample of the hour it was asked in.
- **The fresh block is refused.** If the endpoint answers the call for a new block with an error of its own (rate, plan limit), the run stops there and the hour tries again, as below.
- **The network is down.** After three tries the run stops at once (the other tokens would only wait out the same timeouts) and marks what is left for another try.

A row is never written with a price from one block and quotes from another, and a token whose quotes failed gets no row and no cost.

## Run it

```sh
pnpm risk-evm:collect                # one run, about 10 seconds and 110 RPC calls for 21 tokens
pnpm risk-evm:collect --rediscover   # look for the deepest pools again first
pnpm risk-evm:collect --loop         # one run now, then one an hour, until stopped
pnpm risk-evm:import                 # load the JSONL into risk_asset_snapshots (needs the database)
```

### The loop

- It runs on a fixed hourly grid from its start. Runs never overlap: inside the loop one run ends before the next starts, `run.lock` keeps a one-off run and the loop apart, and `loop.lock` stops a second loop. Ctrl-C or SIGTERM lets an attempt in progress finish.
- **Second chances within the hour.** If tokens are left without a row for a reason that may pass (network down, endpoint refusing, block state gone), the loop tries again for those tokens only, about 2, 6, 14, 30 and 50 minutes after the first attempt (`RETRY_AFTER_MIN` in `slot.ts`). A ten-minute outage costs minutes, and one of 45 minutes still leaves the hour its sample. No retry starts within two minutes of the next scheduled run. A late retry does mean that hour's sample for the retried tokens can sit ten minutes before the next hour's. A token is not retried when its pools are the reason (no eligible pool, no sell quote) or its call reverted: the same call gives the same answer. A one-off run makes one attempt.
- **A sleeping Mac.** macOS stops the process while the machine sleeps. An idle Mac sleeps on its own, so run the loop under `caffeinate -i`, which prevents idle sleep while the command runs:

  ```sh
  nohup caffeinate -i pnpm risk-evm:collect --loop >> data/risk-evm/collect.log 2>&1 &
  ```

  `caffeinate -i` does not stop sleep from a closed lid or a low battery. If the machine sleeps anyway:
  - a run caught mid-way finishes on a fresh block when the machine wakes (above), or stops and is retried if the network is not back yet;
  - on waking, the loop does not catch up the hours it slept through. It runs the latest scheduled hour, late, only if at least half the interval is left before the next scheduled run (with the hourly grid: it woke in the first 30 minutes of that hour). Otherwise it waits for the grid. So two samples are never closer than half an interval;
  - each hour that got no run, slept through or woken into too late, gets a line in the run log saying which.
- If a loop refuses to start after a crash and none is running, delete `data/risk-evm/loop.lock`.
- Nothing here installs a scheduled job.

### The run log

`data/risk-evm/runs.jsonl` has two kinds of line. A line per attempt holds the block, the rows written, the calls made, `repins` (fresh blocks taken), `scheduledAt`, `attempt`, and each token's error. A line with `"event":"slot"` closes each scheduled hour: `rows` out of `tokens`, `attempts`, the tokens still `missing` with the reason, and how it `ended` (`complete`, `nothing to retry`, `out of attempts`, `next run is due`, `stopped`, or `missed` for an hour with no run at all). A run started by hand closes with `"event":"one_off"` instead, so it does not count as an hour. To list the gaps in the sample:

```sh
jq -c 'select(.event == "slot" and .rows < .tokens) | {scheduledAt, rows, ended, error, missing}' data/risk-evm/runs.jsonl
```

### Other notes

- The import is idempotent: the table's key is `(asset_mint, fetched_at)` and existing rows are left alone.
- Settings are in `.env.example` under "EVM depth collector". Tokens, addresses and chains are in `config.ts`; Base is there, switched off (`--chain base` runs it once).
- Curves: `pnpm risk:compute` fits every row of `risk_asset_snapshots`, these included, and stores an EVM curve under the collector's symbol and `evmq-0.1` (the last section). Nothing scheduled runs the import or that compute for these rows: the API's answer for an EVM stock is as new as the last `pnpm risk-evm:import` and `pnpm risk:compute` run by hand.

## The token list and every pool

Two commands beside the hourly collector (PLAN-UNIVERSE RU.2, gate `UNIVERSE`). They are read-only (`eth_getLogs`, `eth_call`, public GETs), they are run by hand, and the hourly run reads nothing they write: a plain `pnpm risk-evm:collect` behaves as before.

```sh
pnpm risk-evm:universe                    # the issuer's token list, each address checked on chain: 3 seconds, 2 RPC calls
pnpm risk-evm:discover                    # every pool of every token: about 30 minutes, 1,500 RPC calls (4,200 the first time)
pnpm risk-evm:discover --check-collector  # and compare with the pools the hourly collector would keep
pnpm risk-evm:discover --only NVDA,SPY    # some symbols only
pnpm risk-evm:discover --no-logs          # without the creation events (the fallback, with its gaps stated)
```

**`universe`** reads the issuer's registry (`api.robinhood.com/rhj/assets`) and asks each address for `decimals()` and `symbol()`. A token whose contract is silent or disagrees with the registry stays in the file as `confirmed: false` with the reason. It writes `data/risk-evm/universe-<chain>-<stamp>.json`. On 2026-10-05: 194 tokens, all confirmed.

**`discover`** (method `evm-discovery-0.1`) writes `data/risk-evm/discovery-<chain>-<stamp>.json`: a summary per token, and one row per pool.

1. **Where pools come from.** Three sources, merged by pool id:
   - the creation events: `PoolCreated` of the Uniswap v3 factory and `Initialize` of the v4 pool manager, filtered on the tokens (either side of the pair). An event is the contract's own word, so it needs no second check. The events are kept in `data/risk-evm/creation-logs-<chain>.json`; a later run reads only the blocks since (`--rescan` starts over).
   - DexScreener, every pair of the token (at most 30 a token). It is the only source for other venues. A v3-style pool it names must answer `token0()` and `token1()`; one that claims the allowlisted factory must be named by that factory's `getPool`, or it is refused.
   - the factory asked directly: `getPool` for each pair seen, at each fee tier seen. On Oct 5 it named the same 2,544 pools as the events, and none besides.
2. **One row per pool, keyed on the token address.** `token` is the stock's address as the registry writes it; a symbol is only a label. A pool of two stocks is one row, filed under token0 (the lower address), with `otherIsStock: true` and `filedUnder: "token0_of_two_stocks"`.
3. **What the vault can reach.** `reachable` is true for a pool of the allowlisted factory and for a v4 pool with no hook. Anything else is kept and marked: `unreachableReason` is `has_hook` or `other_venue`. `againstDollar` says whether the other side is the dollar token, which is what the hourly collector quotes.
4. **The money in a pool** (`tvlUsd`, with `tokenUsd` and `otherUsd` for the two sides):
   - a v3-style pool: the balances the pool holds (`balanceOf`), each at its token's price. `tvlMethod: "balances_held_by_the_pool"`.
   - a v4 pool has no balance of its own (the pool manager holds every pool's money). Its row is what its positions hold between price / 1.5 and price × 1.5: the tick bitmap and the liquidity of each initialized tick in that band are read at the same block as the price, and the amounts are added up tick by tick. `tvlMethod: "v4_positions_within_band_of_the_price"`. Liquidity placed further out is not counted.
   - the same sum is made on Uniswap v3 pools and stored as `bandUsd` beside the measured balances. On Oct 5, over the 109 v3 dollar pools of $1,000 or more, it came to 98% of the balances at the median (88% at the 10th percentile, 99% at the 90th). Against DexScreener's own figure, the v4 rows above $50,000 sit at 98% at the median.
   - `tvlUsd` is `null` with `tvlReason` when it was not measured, never zero: `token_not_priced`, `other_token_not_priced`, `stock_side_below_floor_other_token_not_looked_up`, `pool_state_not_read`.
   - a pool read as empty (no balance; on v4, no liquidity at the price at that block, though it may hold positions further out) has no row. It is counted on its token under `idle`. A pool whose read failed keeps its row, with `pool_state_not_read`.
5. **Prices** (the `prices` list; each names its pool and block). The dollar token counts as one dollar, as in the collector. A stock is priced by the mid of the reachable dollar pool holding the most dollar tokens (a Uniswap v3 pool's balance, a hookless v4 pool's dollar side within the band), if that is at least $1,000 (`--min-ref-usd`) and the pool has liquidity in range; otherwise it has no price. Any other token is looked up the same way, but only where a pool's stock side is worth $100 or more (`--min-side-usd`). The native coin takes the price of the wrapped coin the v4 position manager names (`WETH9()`).
6. **State is read at one block per pool.** The endpoint drops a block's state within minutes and a full pass takes longer, so the pass moves to a fresh block every 45 seconds. Each row carries its own `block` and `fetchedAt`; the file gives the first and the last.
7. **What a run could not have seen** is on each token under `gaps`: DexScreener failed for it, DexScreener returned its cap of 30 (other venues may have more), or the creation events were not available.

### What the endpoints allowed for `eth_getLogs` (probe of 2026-10-05)

| Question | `rpc.mainnet.chain.robinhood.com` | `robinhood.drpc.org` (free) |
|---|---|---|
| One query over the chain's life (81 million blocks) | refused: "only 10000000 are allowed" | refused: "ranges over 10000 blocks are not supported on free plan" |
| Ten million blocks, no token filter | refused where it matches more than 10,000 logs | as above |
| Ten million blocks, one value in each topic | answered | as above |
| A list of tokens in one topic | at most 100,000 blocks a query | as above |
| Ten such queries in one HTTP request, one request a second | answered; 16 refusals for rate in 3,240 queries, each answered on the next try | not tried |
| Fifty in one request | refused for rate | not tried |

So the public endpoint lists every pool, in 3,240 queries of 100,000 blocks (13 minutes, once). The fallback was not needed; it exists and is tested (`--no-logs`): DexScreener and `getPool` only, with `v4_pools_from_dexscreener_only` on every token. The run records its own probe in the file (`logsProbe`).

### The run of 2026-10-05 (blocks 81,044,145 to 81,057,597)

- 100,538 v4 pools and 2,544 Uniswap v3 pools name one of the 194 tokens. 38,434 of them have no row: nothing in the pool, or on v4 no liquidity at the price at that block (such a pool may still hold positions further out). 64,845 have a row. Most are not stock markets: 40,038 of the rows carry one launch hook and pair a stock token with a newly made token.
- 2,140 rows have a measured TVL, $91.0M together; 728 hold $1,000 or more, 543 of them reachable. By venue, pools of $1,000 or more: Uniswap v3 173 ($43.7M), Uniswap v4 430 ($43.3M, of which 60 hooked pools hold $7.0M), other venues 125 ($3.9M).
- 98 of the 194 tokens have a price: 46 from a Uniswap v3 dollar pool, 52 from a v4 one. The other 96 have no dollar pool holding $1,000, so their 2,248 rows are `token_not_priced`.
- 60,457 rows pair a stock with a token that has no dollar price here. For 52,361 the price was not looked up, because the stock side is under $100; for 8,096 it was looked up and no dollar pool of $1,000 exists. 994 of those hold $1,000 or more on the stock side.
- All 54 pools the hourly collector would keep for its 21 tokens are among the rows, all `reachable` (`collectorCheck` in the file).
- DexScreener answered for every token in this run. In the run before it failed for one (JOBY), which then carried `dexscreener_failed_other_venues_not_listed`; a file should be checked for that gap before it is used.

Known limits:

- A v4 row leaves out liquidity further than a third below or a half above the price. A v4 pool whose band holds more than 900 initialized ticks is not summed (`pool_state_not_read`).
- Other venues are only known through DexScreener, 30 pairs a token: 21 tokens were at that cap.
- A price is one pool's mid at one block. It values a pool; it is not the price a trade gets, and it is never mixed with an oracle (gate `ORACLE-VS-DEX`).
- A pool of two stocks is filed under one. Whether it also counts for the other is decided where such pools are routed.

## The cut

`pnpm risk-evm:pareto` (PLAN-UNIVERSE RU.3, method `evm-cut-0.1`) applies the 80% rule (`trackedSet` of `packages/risk`) to the newest discovery file. It reads that one file and calls nothing.

```sh
pnpm risk-evm:pareto                       # the newest discovery file, 80% and $1,000
pnpm risk-evm:pareto --discovery <file>    # another file
pnpm risk-evm:pareto --share 0.8 --min-pool-usd 1000
pnpm risk-evm:pareto --allow-gaps          # a file in which DexScreener failed for a token
pnpm risk-evm:pareto --allow-old           # a file more than a day old
```

It writes `data/risk-evm/cut-<chain>-<stamp>.json` (the stamp is the discovery file's) and prints the same in words. A cut by another share or floor is written beside it with the rule in its name (`…-share0.9-min1000.json`), so the rule's own file is never replaced by it. It refuses a discovery file more than 24 hours old, and one in which a token carries `dexscreener_failed_other_venues_not_listed`; with `--allow-gaps` the file is used and the token is named in the output.

What the file holds, and what it does not decide:

- **The mapping.** One row per pool: `address` is the pool id, `asset` the address of the stock the pool is filed under, `tvlUsd` as discovery measured it. A TVL that was not measured stays `null`: it is left out of the ranking and the total and counted (`counts.unmeasured`, by reason), never zero.
- **`shares`**: pools and stocks at 80, 90, 95 and 99%. **`tracked`**: the stocks of the 80% cut, each with its pools in the cut, every ranked pool, how many the vault reaches, and its pools left out as dust or as unmeasured. **`cut`** and **`pools`**: the rows themselves.
- **`unpricedTokens`**: the stocks with no dollar pool of $1,000. Their pools have no TVL and cannot enter the cut. Whether a thinner pool may price a stock is not decided.
- **`unrankedHoldingStock`**: rows with no TVL whose stock side alone is $1,000 or more, by stock, venue and reason. Not ranked.
- **`withoutV4`**: the same rule with the v4 rows taken out, because a v4 TVL is a band sum and a v3 TVL is the balances. Printed in full only when the two name different stocks.
- **`twoStockPools`**: the pools of two stocks that touch a tracked stock. The rule counts such a pool for the stock it is filed under (token0) only; whether it counts for both is not decided.
- **`vsCollector`**: the tracked stocks against the tokens of `config.ts`, and for each collected token that is not tracked, why and at what share it would enter.

### The run of 2026-10-05 (on `discovery-robinhood-20261005T1947.json`)

- 728 pools ranked ($90.9M). 80%: 93 pools, **30 stocks**, 427 ranked pools of those stocks ($84.0M), 274 of them reachable. 90%: 154 pools, 48 stocks. 95%: 225 and 67. 99%: 440 and 89.
- The 30: AAPL AMC AMD AMZN COIN COST CRCL DELL DJT GLD GME GOOGL HIMS INTC LLY META MSFT MSTR MU NVDA PLTR QQQ RDDT SGOV SLV SNDK SPCX SPY TSLA USO. Against the collector's 21: 20 are in both; AMC, COST, DJT, GME, HIMS, LLY, PLTR, QQQ, RDDT and SPCX are tracked and not collected; TSM is collected and not tracked (its largest pool is rank 102; any cut above 82.0% names it).
- The 93 pools of the cut: 42 Uniswap v3 ($36.8M) and 41 hookless v4 ($29.2M), all reachable; 8 hooked v4 ($6.0M) and 2 on another venue ($0.8M), not reachable.
- Without the v4 pools (298 pools, $47.6M) the cut names 29 stocks: IBM and NFLX enter; AMD, PLTR and SNDK leave.
- 19 of the 93 are pools of SPY against another stock ($9.3M), all filed under SPY. If such a pool also counted for its other side, TSM would be named too.
- 994 rows with no TVL hold $1,000 or more on the stock side, $5.0M of stock tokens in all, 796 of them under tracked stocks ($4.4M); 944 are v4 pools.
- 96 tokens have no price. DexScreener was at its cap of 30 pairs for 21 tokens, all of them tracked, so pools on other venues may be missing for those.

## The oracle map

`pnpm risk-evm:oracles` (PLAN-UNIVERSE RU.5, method `evm-oracles-0.1`) gives each tracked stock of the newest cut its Chainlink feed, or the reason it has none. Read-only: one public GET (Chainlink's reference directory, `feeds-robinhood-mainnet.json`) and one `eth_call` through Multicall3 at one block.

```sh
pnpm risk-evm:oracles                    # the newest cut and token list in data/risk-evm/
pnpm risk-evm:oracles --cut <file>       # another cut file
pnpm risk-evm:oracles --universe <file>  # another token list
pnpm risk-evm:oracles --allow-old        # a cut whose discovery is more than a day old
```

It writes `data/risk-evm/oracles-<chain>-<stamp>.json` (the stamp is the time of the block read) and prints the same in words, ending with the count and the names of the tracked stocks without a confirmed feed. The file is not committed and the hourly collector reads nothing of it. It refuses a cut more than 24 hours old, a token list that does not hold every tracked stock, and a directory in which no feed names a token of the registry (a failed read is not thirty stocks without a feed).

One row per tracked stock, keyed on the token address: `feed` (the address, `description`, `decimals`, the round's `answer`, `price` and `updatedAt`, `ageSeconds`, the session at the block) or `feed: null` with `reason`. Every row carries `source`, `fetchedAt`, `method` and `provenance`. The tokens of `config.ts` that are not tracked are in `collectedNotTracked`, apart. The file states the following in `stated`, so nothing below is chosen silently:

- **How a feed is tied to a token.** By the directory's `name` and the token's symbol. The directory names no token address, so the symbol is the only tie. The name must read as the symbol, `RH` and the symbol, or `Robinhood` and the symbol, then `/ USD` or `-USD` (the forms in use on Oct 5: `GLD / USD`, `RHSPY / USD`, `Robinhood QQQ / USD`, `Robinhood DELL-USD`). The directory's `docs.baseAsset` is not used: three entries lack it and one reads `RHDELL`. Every tie that is not one to one is refused, and nothing picks between candidates: two registry tokens sharing a symbol get no feed (`symbol_shared_by_tokens`), two feeds naming one token are both listed in `candidates` (`two_feeds_name_the_token`), one feed reading as two tokens, by the directory's name or by its own description, is refused (`feed_names_two_tokens`).
- **How a feed is confirmed.** By its own contract: `description()` must name the token by the same rule, `decimals()` must equal the directory, `latestRoundData()` must give a positive answer with a time not after the block. Otherwise there is no feed and the row says why (`description_does_not_name_the_token`, `no_answer_from_the_feed`, `decimals_differ_from_directory`, `answer_not_positive`, `round_time_not_in_the_past`). `no_feed` means the directory lists none.
- **Which address is stored.** The directory's `proxyAddress`, the one the vault would read: the aggregator behind a proxy is replaced when a feed is upgraded and the proxy stays. `aggregator()` of the proxy is recorded and compared with the directory's `contractAddress`, and the listed aggregator is called directly once to record whether it answers (GLD's does not). The second proxy the directory lists ("Shared SVR") is recorded and not read.
- **The price.** Recorded as read (`answer`, an integer in the feed's decimals) and with the point placed (`price`). It is not compared with, corrected by or blended into a pool price (gate `ORACLE-VS-DEX`); RU.7 records it over time and RU.9 measures the gap. No multiplier is applied to anything.
- **Age.** `ageSeconds` is the block's time less `updatedAt`. An old answer is still a confirmed feed: nothing is refused for age. The file counts the feeds older than the vault's 26 hours and older than their own heartbeat, and says whether the block was in the US session by the calendar of `packages/risk` (`fixtures/risk/us-market-holidays.json`).
- **Funds and the treasury token** (`funds`: SPY, QQQ, GLD, SLV, USO, SGOV): whether a feed exists and what the directory says it prices. `token_with_multiplier` is the directory's product `primaryTokenizedPrice`, which Chainlink documents as the share's price times the issuer's multiplier (https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/tokenized-equity-feeds). `token_from_pools` is its attribute `dex_state_price`. Where the directory says neither, the answer is `null` (`not_stated_in_directory`). The registry's multiplier is printed beside and applied to nothing.

Every feed of the directory is read, whatever it is matched to (five reads each: `description()`, `decimals()`, `latestRoundData()` and `aggregator()` of the proxy, `latestRoundData()` of the listed aggregator), so the calls depend on the directory alone. `feedsOfOtherTokens` lists the feeds that name a registry token outside both lists.

### The run of 2026-10-05 (block 81,159,297, 23:03 UTC, off session; on `cut-robinhood-20261005T1947.json`)

- 58 feeds in the directory, none left out. 290 contract reads in one `eth_call`; 2 RPC calls, 0.6 seconds with the GET.
- **24 of the 30 tracked stocks have a confirmed feed. 6 have none (`no_feed`): AMC, COST, DJT, HIMS, LLY, RDDT.** No feed was refused, no symbol is shared by two tokens, no stock has two feeds.
- TSM, collected and not tracked, has a confirmed feed.
- Every confirmed feed has 8 decimals and points at the aggregator the directory lists. The contracts name themselves in four ways: `Robinhood X / USD` (12 of the 24), `RHX / USD` (9), `Robinhood X-USD` (2: DELL, SGOV), `X / USD` (1: GLD).
- Ages at the block, 3 hours after the close: 3 minutes (SPCX) to 9.1 hours (AAPL), and 23.0 hours for SGOV. None older than 26 hours or than its 24-hour heartbeat.
- The six funds all have a feed. SPY, QQQ, SLV and USO: `token_with_multiplier`. **GLD: `token_from_pools`**, a reference price from the state of exchanges on chain, market hours "Crypto"; its aggregator does not answer a direct call. **SGOV: not stated**, the directory entry carries no product or asset name.
- 11 feeds name a registry token outside both lists: ASML, BABA, CLSK, CRWV, EWY, IONQ, NBIS, ORCL, RGTI, RKLB, USAR.

## The asset list

`pnpm risk:universe robinhood` (PLAN-UNIVERSE RU.4) writes `scripts/risk/universe/robinhood.json` from the newest cut, oracle map and token list: one row per tracked stock, keyed on the token address, with its pools, its oracle or the reason it has none, and `autoRebalance`. It is committed, and it is what RU.6 makes the collector read. It refuses a cut and an oracle map that do not name the same token addresses. See `scripts/risk/universe/README.md`.

## A run on the asset list

`pnpm risk-evm:collect --list` (PLAN-UNIVERSE RU.6) collects the tracked stocks of `scripts/risk/universe/<chain>.json` instead of the hand list of `config.ts`, and keeps every reachable pool of each. `--loop --list` does the same every hour. **Without `--list` a run is exactly what it was**: the hand list, three pools a token, the same `evmq-0.1` rows, the same pool file. The list is committed, so its presence alone must not change a loop that is already running; that is why it is an option and not the default.

```sh
pnpm risk-evm:collect --list            # one run on the list
RISK_EVM_MAX_POOLS=5 pnpm risk-evm:collect --list   # at most five pools a token
```

- **Tokens.** The rows of the list. Their pools come from the cut the list names (`inputs.cut`), which must be in `data/risk-evm/`: the list holds counts, the cut holds the pools. A list whose cut is not on the machine, or a cut whose stocks and pools are not the ones the list counts, stops the run. A chain with no list file is collected from the hand list, and the run says so.
- **Pools.** The cut's pools of the token that the vault reaches and that pair it with the dollar token go to the same on-chain confirmation a DexScreener candidate gets (the factory's `getPool`, the position manager's `poolKeys`, no hook). DexScreener is not asked. The confirmed list is kept in `pools-<chain>-list.json`, apart from the hand list's `pools-<chain>.json`, and is confirmed again when it is a day old or the list names another cut. If that confirmation fails, the run goes on with the file only when it is of the same cut; pools confirmed from another cut are never used. A loop reads the list once, when it starts: a new list takes effect when the loop is started again. The per-token limit is a setting (`RISK_EVM_MAX_POOLS`): three on the hand list, every pool on the asset list.
- **The asset row** is `evmq-0.1`, unchanged: the best single pool per size, now chosen among all the token's dollar pools. Its `source` names the cut and the list instead of DexScreener.
- **The pool rows.** `pools/<day>.jsonl`, method `evmq-pools-0.1`: one row per reachable pool the list counts for the token, at the block of the asset row (a token with no dollar pool has no asset row, and its pool rows carry the block the run holds), with the pool's own quote at every size (`sell`, `buy`: `outUsd`, `costPct`, `unfilledShare` against the pool's own mid), its `midUsd`, `kind`, `venue`, `fee`, `tickSpacing`, the cut's TVL (`listTvlUsd`, `listTvlAt`: not read in the run) and `source`, `fetchedAt`, `method`, `provenance`. A pool with no quote has `quoted: false` and a `reason`; `sell` and `buy` are `null` when it was not asked, and a point per size with every figure `null` when it was asked and gave nothing. Never a zero:
  - `not_against_the_dollar_token`: the pool pairs the stock with ETH or with another stock. One call cannot price it in dollars; a two-hop quote is not built.
  - `not_confirmed_on_chain`, `beyond_the_pool_limit` (confirmed, and left out by `RISK_EVM_MAX_POOLS`), `no_price_at_the_block`, `mid_far_from_the_median` (more than 2% from the median of the token's pools, as before), `no_quote_at_any_size`.
  - A pool the vault cannot reach (DU3) has no row and is never asked.
- **The address** of a token is written as the cut spells it, in the issuer registry's mixed case. That is the spelling `config.ts` has for the tokens collected before, so their history joins; the list itself holds the lower-case form.
- **Tokens of the hand list that are not tracked** (TSM on Oct 5) are named at the start of a list run and not read by it. Their rows continue only where a run without `--list` continues.
- `autoRebalance` and `autoRebalanceOpen` are not read: every tracked stock is collected.
- What happens to a stock that leaves the list on a later run is not decided; a list run reads the list as it is.

### The run of 2026-10-06 (block 81,202,501, 00:16 UTC, off session, by hand into a temporary folder)

- 30 asset rows, one per tracked stock, none missing. 129 dollar pools sent to the chain, 129 confirmed.
- **274 pool rows, one per reachable pool: 126 quoted, 3 `mid_far_from_the_median`, 145 `not_against_the_dollar_token`.** Of the reachable pools' $73.6M, $50.3M is in the 129 dollar pools, $12.7M in 99 pools against ETH, $9.9M in 40 pools against another stock and $0.7M in 6 pools whose other token the cut does not name.
- 271 RPC calls in 48 requests, 29 seconds, with the confirmation of the pools. The hand list's run is 54 pools and about ten seconds.
- **The asset row barely moves.** Against the three deepest dollar pools of each token at the same block, a pool beyond the three was the best at 4 of 480 points (MSTR and SGOV at $100, by 2.3 and 0.9 basis points). What the wider run adds is the pool rows, for a split across pools later.

## The oracle beside the pool price

A list run also reads the Chainlink feed of every tracked stock that has one (PLAN-UNIVERSE RU.7, method `evmo-0.1`): `latestRoundData()` of each proxy the asset list names, in one Multicall3 call at the block the run holds, before the first pool is asked. The rows go to `oracle/<day>.jsonl`. A run without `--list` reads no feed.

- **A row** is one feed at one block: `asset`, `assetMint`, `feed` (the proxy), `fetchedAt` and `slot` (the block's), `roundId`, `answer` (as read, an integer in the feed's decimals), `price` (the same with its point), `decimals`, `updatedAt` (the feed's own time for the answer), `ageSeconds` (the block's time less `updatedAt`), and `source`, `method`, `methodVersion`, `provenance`. A feed that does not answer, or answers zero or less, is a row with `price: null` and a `reason` (`no_answer_from_the_feed`, `answer_not_positive`), never a zero.
- **Kept apart (gate `ORACLE-VS-DEX`).** The answer is written as read. It is not compared with, corrected by or blended into a pool price, no multiplier is applied, and nothing is refused for age. The asset row and the pool rows do not depend on it: a refused oracle read costs the run only these rows (`oracle_read_failed` in the log, `oracleError` in the run's summary).
- **The same block.** The feeds are read at the block the run pins first, which is the block of the asset rows. A token the run measures again on a fresh block keeps the oracle row of the first block, and so does every token when the run had to take a fresh block before its first pool (its block grew older than two minutes, or its state was gone); each row carries its own `slot`, so the two can always be told apart.
- **A stock with no oracle** (`oracle: null` in the list) is not asked and has no row. A retry within the hour reads the feeds of the tokens it retries, at its own block, so a retried token has one oracle row per attempt; all are kept. A refused oracle read is not tried again: that hour has pool rows and no oracle rows.
- **The import.** `pnpm risk-evm:import` loads the rows that carry a price into `risk_price_observations`: `chain` as the row says (`robinhood`), `price_source` `chainlink`, `mint` the token address as the collector writes it, `ref` the proxy, `observed_at` and `slot` the block's, `source_ts` the feed's `updatedAt`, `quote` `usd`. The table's key leaves an existing row as it is, so a second import inserts nothing. No migration.

### The run of 2026-10-06 (block 81,211,551, 00:31 UTC, off session, by hand into a temporary folder)

- 24 feeds asked in one call, 24 answered; 24 rows. The six stocks with no feed have none.
- Ages at the block: 1 minute to 10.6 hours, 4.6 hours at the median (the US session had closed 4.5 hours before). GLD's answer was 9.2 hours old.
- With the feeds the run was 288 RPC calls in 52 requests, 30 seconds. The feeds are one call of those; the rest moves with the pools, run to run.

## Thirty days of trades (PLAN-UNIVERSE RU.14, gate `EVM-HISTORY`)

Quotes cannot be read at a past block on the public RPC, so the exit-cost history of a Robinhood stock starts with the loop. Trades can: the chain serves `Swap` events for its whole life, 100,000 blocks a query. `pnpm risk-evm:history` walks them for every pool of the cut the asset list names (427 on the cut of Oct 5: 195 Uniswap v3 pools, 232 v4 pools, reachable or not), and `pnpm risk-evm:flow-import` turns them into the same `risk_pool_flow` rows Solana's Step 5b history fills, so an EVM stock's fact sheet answers its `flow` block.

```sh
RISK_EVM_DIR=… pnpm risk-evm:history --days 30     # read-only; 30 days is 256 windows per filter, 15 to 30 minutes
RISK_EVM_DIR=… pnpm risk-evm:flow-import           # the rows into the database; writes hourly/<pool>.jsonl beside the swaps
```

- **Two filters, newest window first.** The v3 pools' addresses in one `address` list with the v3 `Swap` topic; the pool manager with the v4 `Swap` topic and the pool ids in the second topic. A window the endpoint refuses for its 10,000-log cap is halved until it answers; any other refusal stops the walk, and the next run resumes from the oldest window it finished (`cursor.json`). A finished walk is not walked again: move the folder aside first.
- **Time.** A log carries its block, not its time. Headers are read every 10,000 blocks (about 17 minutes of chain) and a swap's time is linear between the two around it; the run reads one exact block in every 25 gaps and records the largest difference (`maxTimeErrorS`, 1 s on Oct 6). The day a swap is filed under follows from that time.
- **The two sign conventions.** v3 logs the pool's deltas (positive came in); v4 logs the swapper's (negative went in). `swapSides` in `history.ts` is the one place that knows, and the test proves it on the recording: across more than a thousand consecutive swaps of one pool, a swap that sends token 0 in never raises `sqrtPriceX96`.
- **Files**, under `<RISK_EVM_DIR>/history/<chain>/`: `swaps/<pool>/<day>.jsonl` (block, log index, transaction, both amounts as the event signed them, `sqrtPriceX96`, liquidity, tick, the fee a v4 pool reported, the sender, the interpolated time); `<day>.done` beside each day file once every window of that UTC day is in (a pool with no swap that day has neither), with the source, the method and the time error; `headers.jsonl`; `cursor.json`; `runs.jsonl`; after an import, `hourly/<pool>.jsonl`.
- **Prices by the hour** (`hourlyRows`): a pool's price is its last swap's in the hour, carried for up to 24 hours when an hour has none. The quote in dollars: the dollar token at par (`usdg_at_par`); another stock at its own deepest dollar pool's price that hour (`implied_from_<pool>`); the native token and its wrapper at the chain's one price for the hour, the swap-weighted median of what every native-quoted pool that swapped implies from its own price and its stock's dollar price (`native_median_of_<n>_pools`), carried up to 24 hours, so a near-empty pool pushed to an extreme is valued at the market's price, not its own. A quote with no dollar price that hour, or a token whose decimals the issuer registry does not give, leaves the swap counted and unvalued (`unpriced_swaps`), with the reason in the import's summary. No depth: the ±2% depth of Solana's replay needs the pool's layout, which is not reconstructed; `median_depth_sell_usd` is null and turnover answers with that reason.
- **The rows.** `buildFlowRows` (`history-flow.ts`) feeds `@colosseum/risk`'s own `addSwap` and `poolFlow`: one row per pool, regime (and `all`) and window (24 h, 7 d, 28 d ending at the newest swap), `flow-0.1`, `source` and `method` naming the chain's logs and `history-evm-0.1`. A swap seen twice (a walk resumed after a crash) counts once. `asset_mint` is the stock's address as the cut spells it, the collector's spelling. The EVM pools get no `risk_pools` row (that table feeds `/risk/assets`, the plan fact sheet's exits and `/risk/recoverable`, which must not see them: DU6), so each flow row carries its own `venue`, `quote_symbol` and `quote_mint` (migration 0014; the Solana import fills them from `risk_pools`, this one from the cut), and the sheet reads the row's first. The insert leaves a row that is there alone, so rows written before migration 0014 do not gain the columns by a second import: the Solana rows are filled by the migration itself from `risk_pools`; EVM rows are removed and imported again (`delete from risk_pool_flow where pool like '0x%' and venue is null`, then `pnpm risk-evm:flow-import`), as was done on 2026-10-06.
- **Not compared with anything.** The fee a v4 pool reports is recorded and not applied; no price here is set against the oracle (`ORACLE-VS-DEX`).

### The run of 2026-10-06 (blocks 55,630,803 to 81,290,803, Sep 6 02:45Z to Oct 6 02:46Z)

427 pools, 257 windows, 2,567 headers and 102 exact blocks (interpolation 4 s off at most), 4,000 queries of which 1,747 halvings and 4 waits for rate, 76 minutes: 15,388,150 swaps for 411 pools, 6.3 GB. The import wrote 6,405 rows; 417,876 swaps (2.7%) unpriced: 362,401 in the ten pools whose quote token the registry does not know, 48,155 quoted in a stock with no dollar pool in the cut, 7,306 with nothing on either side (a hook took them), 14 with no dollar price that hour. NVDA's 28 days on the sheet: 2,786,831 swaps, $977.5M, 36 pools. The native token's price is the chain's one price per hour, the swap-weighted median across its pools: implied from each pool's own price, two near-empty pools had valued themselves at 10^38 dollars.

Tests: `pnpm vitest run tests/risk-evm-history.test.ts` on `fixtures/risk-evm/robinhood-history.json.gz`, a recorded quarter-day walk of seven pools (`record-history-fixture.ts`): each decoder read by hand, the sign conventions, the halving, the resume, the interpolation against exact blocks, the hourly prices and the flow rows recomputed by hand, and an insert inside a transaction that is rolled back.

## The asset universe (ASSET-1)

`pnpm risk:assets robinhood` (PLAN-ASSETS AS.3, gate `ASSET-UNIVERSE`) writes `scripts/risk/assets/robinhood.json`: every Robinhood Chain token of the product's classes, read on chain, with a status and its reason from the reviewed table `scripts/risk/assets/robinhood.verdicts.json`. The builder is `assets.ts` (the command's part), `assets-read.ts` (the reads, through the client and fetch it is given) and `assets-list.ts` (the list from the reads, no I/O); the decoders are `packages/risk/src/assets/evm.ts`. Read-only: public GETs, `eth_call`, `eth_getStorageAt`, `eth_getCode`. No file the hourly loop runs was changed, and the loop reads nothing this writes. How a row is decided is in `scripts/risk/assets/README.md`; what is read, here.

```sh
RISK_EVM_DIR=… pnpm risk:assets robinhood                      # read everything again (about an hour: CoinGecko's keyless pages)
pnpm risk:assets robinhood --from <reads.json.gz>              # build from reads already made, with no network
RISK_EVM_DIR=… pnpm risk:assets robinhood --listings <file>    # reuse the GETs of a run, read the chain again
pnpm risk-evm:assets-freeze --from <reads.json.gz>             # the same, and freeze the reads under fixtures/risk-evm/assets/
```

Every live run writes its reads (`reads-<stamp>.json.gz`, with the code samples) and its GETs (`listings-<stamp>.json.gz`) to `RISK_ASSETS_DIR` (default `data/assets/robinhood`), and the names it saw to `names-<stamp>.json` there, whether or not the build goes through: that file is what a person writes the verdicts from. The discovery file is the newest in `RISK_EVM_DIR`, read and never written.

**The reads, in order.**

1. The issuer's registry (`REGISTRY_URL`), every row, cut to the fields the list keeps.
2. Chainlink's directory (`DIRECTORY_URL`), every entry, cut to what `parseDirectory` reads.
3. DexScreener: `latest/dex/search?q=robinhood <name>` for each class name (the prompt's names, the base assets of the directory, USD, EUR), then `token-pairs/v1/robinhood/<token>` for each address the screening note writes and each name a search gave whose symbol names a class, one call every 1.1 seconds; a call that fails is asked once more after 5 seconds and counted. Pairs are kept with their names, addresses, venue and labels only.
4. CoinGecko's token list for the chain and Chainlink CCIP's token directory (one GET each); DexScreener's `tokens/v1/robinhood/<30 addresses>` over every token they list outside the registry (one call every 1.1 seconds), whose 24-hour volume selects the crypto rows (`scripts/risk/assets/README.md`, "Crypto beyond the listings"); then, keyless and one call every 6 seconds, the names of every CoinGecko category, CoinGecko's list of the chain's memecoin category, its list of every coin with its address on each chain, and the page of each token outside that category and outside the registry that the selection kept, a verdict names, or a committed list holds (`git log` of `scripts/risk/assets/robinhood.json`, every version).
5. The chain, at one block: `WETH9()` of the v4 position manager; then, through Multicall3 at that block, `decimals()`, `symbol()`, `name()`, `asset()`, `convertToAssets(1e18)`, `owner()` and `defaultAdmin()` of every address the registry, the note (with its input list and its shelf fixture: every full address written there), WETH9() and the class names of DexScreener give, of every selected token CoinGecko files as a protocol's or a liquid staking token, and of every address a verdict names or a committed version of the list holds, every run, whatever that day's search returned; the three EIP-1967 slots of each, and of each clone's target, by `eth_getStorageAt` (20 addresses a request); `implementation()` and `owner()` of each beacon; `eth_getCode` of every address, every implementation and every clone's target (20 a request), each reduced to its size, whether it has a DELEGATECALL, an EIP-1167 target and the watched selectors it pushes, with its SHA-256; for each token whose running code pushes `getFacet(bytes4)`, `getFacet(<selector>)` for every pause and blacklist selector and the code of each facet named; and the directory's feeds, five reads each as `feeds.ts` reads them.

**The public RPC and the loop.** The endpoint sits behind Cloudflare, which at times answers a request with a challenge (HTTP 403 with `cf-mitigated`); it does so to the hourly loop too: by its run log, 7 of its 12 runs from 14:04 UTC on Oct 10 to 01:04 UTC on Oct 11 lost tokens to `RPC answered HTTP 403`, the first at 15:04, before this work began. Such a request is asked again as it is, up to 8 times 15 seconds apart, and the count is in the run's lines: nothing is solved, disguised or sent elsewhere. A refusal for rate (HTTP 429) is the client's own retry, then the whole chain part again on a new block after 30 seconds, three times at most. No request is sent to the chain in minutes 1 to 14 of an hour (UTC), around the loop's run at minute 4: every request waits for minute 15 (the reads' block may then be gone, and the chain part starts again on a new block).

**What is frozen** (`pnpm risk-evm:assets-freeze`): `fixtures/risk-evm/assets/robinhood-reads-<stamp>.json.gz` holds every read above as the list uses it (the multicall answers as returned, the slots, the code scans, the GETs cut) the discovery file cut to pools grouped by stock token, other side and source, and the rows of every committed version of the list the run started from (address, id, symbol, status, commit), from which the ids are kept; `robinhood-code-<stamp>.json.gz` holds the raw code of six addresses, one of each kind the reads found, for the decoder tests. `tests/risk-assets-robinhood.test.ts` rebuilds the committed list from them with no network.

**The metrics of every row (ASSET-2, AS.5 and AS.6)** are read by `assets-metrics.ts` (`totalSupply()` and the ERC-4626 rates by Multicall3 at one pinned block, outside minutes 1 to 14 and with the same Cloudflare retry; the newest discovery file's pool TVL; the issuer registry's SGOV multiplier) for `pnpm risk:assets-import robinhood`, and hourly by `com.colosseum.assets-robinhood` (`install-assets-job.sh`, minute 38). What each metric is and where it goes: `scripts/risk/assets/README.md`, "Metrics".

The run on the list is tested in `tests/risk-evm-list.test.ts`, which replays two recorded runs for NVDA and GME at one block (`fixtures/risk-evm/robinhood-list-run.json.gz`): every reachable pool, then the three deepest. The oracle map is tested in `tests/risk-evm-oracles.test.ts`, which replays one recorded pass (`fixtures/risk-evm/robinhood-oracles.json.gz`: the directory and the chain's answers at block 81,164,613).

## How these curves reach the API (RISK-1, PLAN-UNIVERSE RU.8)

Built on 2026-10-06. The six lines this section once listed are in `scripts/risk/curve-rows.ts`, the part of `pnpm risk:compute` that has no I/O.

- **Compute.** A snapshot whose method version starts with `evmq-` is fitted like any other and stored in `risk_depth_curves` under the symbol the collector wrote and under its own version (`evmq-0.1`), with a `source` that says "best single pool per size", not "routed". A Solana row is stored as before, `risk-0.3`, with one exception that does not occur in the local database: a Solana address with no row in `risk_pools` now gets the snapshot's own symbol, not its first six letters. Run on the 61,019 snapshots of the local database, the old and the new code wrote the same 282 rows, byte for byte.
- **The readers.** `apps/api/src/curve-version.ts` gives the version an address is read under: `evmq-0.1` for an EVM address, `risk-0.3` for a Solana one (no Solana address starts with `0x`). The liquidity provider (`apps/api/src/liquidity.ts`), the fact sheet (`GET /risk/facts/assets/:id`) and the plan fact sheet (`apps/api/src/facts.ts`) use it, and none of them serves a curve stored for an EVM address under `risk-0.3`. An EVM sheet carries no Solana network fee and no xStocks issuer route: both are `null`. Two scripts still read every `risk-0.3` row and would pick such rows up: `pnpm risk:cost-breakdown` and `scripts/risk/lending-report.ts`.
- **The `assets` rows.** `pnpm db:seed` writes one row per tracked stock of `scripts/risk/universe/robinhood.json`, id `robinhood:<symbol>`. Its `mint` is the address **as the cut the list names spells it** (`inputs.cut`, in `data/risk-evm/`): the place `listRun` takes it from for `asset_mint`. That is the issuer registry's spelling, mixed case for 29 of the 30 and lower case for LLY, so it is copied and never worked out as a checksum. On a machine without that cut the registry rows are seeded, the EVM rows are not, and the run says so. A row offers nothing to a plan (gate `EVM-ROWS`).
- **The check.** `GET /risk/facts/assets/robinhood:nvda` (or the address in the collector's spelling) answers with the symbol `NVDA` and `evmq-0.1`. The lower-case address finds nothing. The other `/risk/assets/:id/…` routes find an asset through `risk_pools`, which has no EVM row (DU6), and answer 404 for these.

**Two jobs on the founder's machine still run code built before this.** They are not touched before Oct 12, and each will write rows for the EVM addresses once these files are imported:

- `com.colosseum.risk-refresh` (minute 10, bundle of Oct 2) runs the old compute: it writes each EVM curve again under `risk-0.3` with the address cut to six letters as its symbol. The readers above never serve those rows; they stay in `risk_depth_curves` until the bundle is rebuilt and someone removes them. It does not write the `evmq-0.1` rows.
- `com.colosseum.risk-prices` (minute 14) reads every row of `risk_price_observations` in its window. With the Chainlink rows in the table it files them as a lending oracle and writes a row in `risk_reference_prices` for each EVM address, under `chain: 'solana'`. The source (`scripts/risk/prices/job.ts`) now reads Solana rows only; the installed bundle does not until it is rebuilt. `pnpm risk:prices-import` reads files, not the table, and is not affected.

Known limits of this step: the provider says one method version for every answer (`risk-0.3`), also for an EVM stock; the vault's asset entries hold an EVM address in lower case, so they do not find these curves by address yet.
