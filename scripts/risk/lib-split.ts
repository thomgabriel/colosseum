 * no tick array read is built as one range with no end, and a Raydium pool with no fee config read is built with a
 * fee of 0 (a Meteora pool with no bin array read has no mid and is skipped, with no line). So a run with two hops
 * off routes what it routed before, and the `split-0.1` rows of a run with them on are the same rows.
 *
 * With two hops on, each stock-to-stock pool is built once and offered in both directions, each of its two stocks
 * traded through the other (the via token). A direction is routed, that is added to the traded stock's `twoHop`, only
 * when all of the following hold. Otherwise it is listed in `notRouted` with the reason of the first that does not:
 * - the pool was built from a whole read. `pool_read_incomplete`: none of its tick or bin arrays was read, or it is a
 *   Raydium CLMM pool and its fee config was not; `failures` has a line that names which (the arrays, when both).
 *   `pool_not_built`: its account is missing or does not decode, with a line in `failures`, or its mid is not a
 *   positive number, with none (a Raydium CPMM pool always: no vault is read for it);
 * - the via token is tracked (`via_not_tracked`);
 * - every dollar and SOL pool built for the via token was read whole, by the same test (`via_pool_read_incomplete`).
 *   One such pool with a gap and the stock is no second hop at all, because the via trade is routed over all of
 *   them. Its pools, their lines in `failures` and its own rows stay as the paragraph above says;
 * - the via token has a dollar or SOL pool built in this capture (`via_has_no_pool_in_this_run`);
 * - the traded stock has one too, which gives its reference price (`asset_has_no_pool_in_this_run`).
 * `via` holds the second hops: for each tracked stock that passed, its own `pools`.
 *
 * Nothing is taken from another snapshot: every account, array, config and price is the capture's own, and a second
 * hop that is missing, was not read or was read with a gap is not routed.
 *
 * Byreal's pools (a capture taken with `--byreal`) are passed over, with no line, unless `opts.byreal` is true: a
 * capture that holds them routes what it routed without them. When asked for, each is built and routed as a Raydium
 * pool is, with one difference: a Byreal pool read with a gap, with a fee its own accounts do not give, or whose
 * arrays do not add up to its liquidity exactly is not built at all, and `failures` names it (`buildPoolSim`).
