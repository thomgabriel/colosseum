// drift, the loss used, and the chain's own band and loss budget at the read.

// basis point of the exact share. The planner tests the band on exact values (`rebalancePlan`), so at
// the very edge of the band the two can differ by under one basis point. Where everything has a price,
// what this rule calls outside the band the planner calls outside too. But a position, or the cash,
// that is past the band by under one basis point can read here as exactly at it, and so inside, while
// the keeper trades it. That is left as it is.

/**
 * The status of a plan from the newest snapshot of its vault: the answer of the first line that holds,
 * in this order.
 *
 * - `verdict`: a verdict was handed in. It wins over every line below, and the answer carries its
 *   rule in place of this one. Not covered now is Off track; covered now but not under stress is
 *   Watch; covered now, under stress or with no stress run, is On track.
 * - `never_read`, no status: there is no snapshot.
 * - `empty`, no status: the vault holds no cash and no position. A deposit counts once the chain
 *   shows the vault holding it. This comes before the loss lines because an empty vault on Solana
 *   with a loss counter left over reads its loss used as 10,000.
 * - `chain_silent`, Off track: a day or more since the chain last answered. That is the later of
 *   `chainAnsweredAt` and the snapshot's own time, since a snapshot is itself an answer of the chain.
 * - `loss_half`, Off track: the loss used is at or past half the chain's loss budget. This is the
 *   line the keeper alerts on, in the same integers, so the two never disagree about it.
 * - `unpriced`, Watch: a position that is held and is a target has no price, so the plan cannot be
 *   weighed. It is the planner's `weighed: false`. A target with no price and none of it held is not
 *   this line: nothing of unknown worth is held. It reads as its whole target under and is held to
 *   the band like any position, though the planner leaves its share in cash.
 * - `no_band`, no status: the chain stated no band, so there is nothing to hold the positions to.
 * - `outside_band`, Watch: a position is further from its target than the band. Exactly at the band
 *   is inside, as the planner counts it. The answer names the position furthest out.
 * - `cash_over`, Watch: the cash is over its share by more than the band. Weights add up to exactly
 *   10,000, so what the cash is over is what the positions together are under. Cash under its share
 *   is not this line: the planner trades the one side only.
 * - `loss_quarter`, Watch: the loss used is at or past a quarter of the budget.
 * - `stale`, Watch: the snapshot is more than two hours old (`SNAPSHOT_STALE_AFTER_SECONDS`).
 *   Exactly two hours is not.
 * - `inside`, On track, on a chain with a loss budget. `inside_no_budget`, On track, on a chain that
 *   keeps none (a budget of null or of zero), where the two loss lines are skipped.
 *
 * `rule` is `TRACK_RULE` on every line but `verdict`. `observedAt` is the snapshot's time, null with
 * no snapshot. `text` is the line as one English sentence and `params` are the figures it names; the
 * web words its own sentence from `line` and `params`.
 *
 * A time ahead of `now` (two clocks that disagree) gives a negative age, which is under every line:
 * never stale, never silent. A vault whose every holding has no price is not empty and goes on down
 * the lines. On Solana its loss used then reads 10,000, the keeper's own figure, and the answer is
 * `loss_half`.
 *
 * It never throws on input the contract allows. A time that is not an ISO instant with its zone is
 * refused with `BasketInputError` (`BadTime`) whatever line would answer, and an amount that is not
 * raw units (`BadAmount`) where it is read.
