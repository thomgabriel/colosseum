 * - Same chain: a line that points at a shared portfolio takes that portfolio's recipe on the plan's
 *   own chain. The shelf holds one recipe per chain for a family (the version in effect), and one
 *   family per slug.
 * - An asset reached twice (directly and through a shared portfolio, or through two) is one target.
 * - Lines under `minLineBps` are dropped, then the smallest are dropped until `maxLines` are left.
 *   What they held is shared out over the lines kept, in proportion. Each dropped line is in
 *   `dropped`; a kept line that this pushed over its ceiling on the shelf is in `overCeiling`.
 * - The targets add up to exactly what the recipe's components add up to (10,000 for a valid one),
 *   less what a shared portfolio in it leaves in cash where its chain's rules let it (SHARED-RULES-V2):
 *   that share stays cash, as in the portfolio itself, with the part of a basis point that does not
 *   divide.
 *
 * The order is largest first, ties by asset id.
