/**
 * The trades that bring `v` to `targets` at `prices`, and what was left out.
 *
 * - Weights are shares of everything the vault holds, cash included. Cash is one dollar, always.
 * - Nothing is planned while every asset is within the band of its target and the cash is no more
 *   than the band over its own share. Once something is outside, the plan brings every asset to its
 *   target, so the cash a purchase needs is there. Cash over its share counts: what a sale leaves
 *   idle is spent by the next plan.
 * - Sales come first, then purchases, and every trade has the chain's cash token on one side.
 * - A sale is only of an asset above its target and stops at the target or just before; a purchase
 *   is only of one below and stops at the target or just before. Both keep a margin for what turning
 *   a value into whole units can lose, so a trade never goes past at the given prices.
 * - No trade worth less than `minTradeUsd`. And no sale worth less than 1 bp of the vault in an asset
 *   that has a target: after a sale lands at any cost, the asset sits a hair over its target, and
 *   selling that hair is a trade a vault refuses.
 * - A position that is held and is not a target is sold whole. Cash keeps what the targets leave of
 *   100%.
 * - An asset with no price is left out and named in `unpriced`. If it is held and is not a target,
 *   the rest is planned without it. If it is a target and none is held, its share stays in cash. If
 *   it is both held and a target, the vault cannot be weighed: `weighed` is false and nothing is
 *   planned, because any plan for the others would be sized on a guess at what it is worth.
 *
 * The amounts are exact at the given prices with no trading cost. A keeper sends the first trade and
 * plans again from fresh state. An owner sending several together passes `costBps`: the purchases
 * then count on every trade losing that much, so the batch has its cash and stops at each target as
 * long as no trade loses more. Split the trades with `batchTrades` to respect a chain's limit per
 * transaction. `lastKeeperAt` is not read: the cooldown is the keeper's to apply.
 *
 * With `purchasesOnly` no sale is planned: the purchases spend the cash over its share alone.
 *
 * Throws `RebalanceError`, and nothing else, for input it cannot use: `BadPolicy`, `BadTargets`,
 * `BadInput` (a price or an amount that is not a plain number, two prices for one asset, cash among
 * the positions), `AssetNotPriced` (the cash token is not on the asset list).
