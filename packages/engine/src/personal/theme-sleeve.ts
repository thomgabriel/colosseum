//
// Or of the stocks a filter matches (gate THEME-MATCHED): a slug that names a filter is filled from
// the sourced attributes of the chain's tracked stocks, by pure code, and held exactly as a curated
// list is. Its lines say it is matched, by what, and from which version of the attributes; it has no
// curator and needs no confirmation. Where the chain lists no stock that carries the value, the
// sleeve holds no name and says so.
//
// Placed before the goal sleeve's stocks and crypto (gate THEME-FIRST): the theme keeps its share of
// an issuer's room, and the goal's stocks take what is left.
//
// - Eligible: the list, with the token the chain lists under each symbol (the first by id the person
//   can hold, where two share one), that the person can hold
//   (what they cannot hold, what the goal allows: a plan to protect or for income
//   holds no stock, gate PROTECT-NO-STOCKS), and that can take a line at this size within `tau` (its
//   measured exit, or its tier where nothing is measured, said as such: gate EXIT-SOURCE).
// - Weights: equal, less for a name the person already holds (as the goal's holdings rule), each name
//   up to its exit ceiling and the cap on one stock; where one name stops, the others take more. An
//   issuer's cap, read per name, scales its names down together.
// - Lines: a name already in the plan keeps its line; a new one takes one of the lines left. When
//   the names outnumber the lines left, the easiest to sell take them: measured names first, by
//   measured capacity, then those on a tier, by its ceiling; ties by id.
// - What no name can take is handed back, with what kept it out: the caller holds it in dollar yield,
//   then cash, and says so on those lines.
