// The order executor: one state machine that walks an order step by step. For each step it asks the
// API to build, holds the bytes to the approved step with the guard, asks the wallet to sign, reports
// to the API, and waits for the chain. The web and an outside agent run the same one.
//
// What it keeps to:
//   The signer is never called without a pass of the guard on those exact bytes.
//   One approved step gets one signature. What was signed is remembered by order and step, and is
//   reported again instead of made again. A second signature needs proof that the first can never
//   land, read from the chain by the caller's own connection, or the person approving the step again.
//   The API's word that a transaction did not land is never enough: it is the one party that gains
//   from a second signature.
//   What a wallet hands back is read before it is reported: it is the transaction the guard passed.
//   Every transition is written to the API before the next step: a build, a report, a cancel.
//   What was approved is worked out once, from the order it was handed. The API's later answers are
//   read for what has happened, never for what a step may do.
