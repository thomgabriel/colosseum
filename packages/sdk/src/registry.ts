// the vault program; its layout is programs/basket's `Recipe` (DESIGN-VAULT 3.7, idl/basket.json):
//
//   discriminator 8 · creator 32 · family_id 32 · current RecipeVersion 453 · pending RecipeVersion 453
//   · last_publish_ts 8 · … (1,022 bytes) · then, on an account with room for them, 4 more lines of the
//   current version and 4 of the pending one (1,294 bytes)
//   RecipeVersion: version u32 · effective_at i64 · meta_hash 32 · count u8 · 12 × (mint 32, weight u16)
//   `count` is every line of the version, up to 16: past twelve, the rest are in the slots after 1,022.

// whose time has come is in effect with no transaction. registry.test.ts holds this to the layout, and
// tests/solana-vault/shared-routes.test.ts to an account the program wrote.
