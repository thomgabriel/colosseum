// The call data a vault hands Uniswap's Universal Router for one trade, read as one of the two shapes
// the builders make (packages/chain-evm/src/vault/routes.ts, `swapCalldata`). In a v4 pool:
//
//   execute(bytes commands, bytes[] inputs, uint256 deadline)
//     commands  one byte: V4_SWAP
//     inputs    one: abi.encode(bytes actions, bytes[] params)
//       actions SWAP_EXACT_IN_SINGLE, SETTLE_ALL, TAKE_ALL
//       params  the swap, (currency, maxAmount) to settle, (currency, minAmount) to take
//
// In a v3 pool (gate V3-ROUTE):
//
//   execute(bytes commands, bytes[] inputs, uint256 deadline)
//     commands  one byte: V3_SWAP_EXACT_IN
//     inputs    one: abi.encode(address recipient, uint256 amountIn, uint256 amountOutMin,
//                               bytes path, bool payerIsUser, uint256[] minHopPriceX36)
//       path    tokenIn (20 bytes), fee (3 bytes), tokenOut (20 bytes): one hop
//
// Every level is read with the codec of abi.ts, which takes only the canonical encoding of what it
// reads: an offset somewhere odd, padding that is not zero and a byte left over are refused at the
// level they are at. Anything that is not this shape throws, and the check refuses the trade. What the
// values must be is the check's to say (check.ts); this file only reads them.
