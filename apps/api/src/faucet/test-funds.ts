// The test faucet behind POST /v1/testnet/fund: it sends a wallet the test tokens and the gas a buy is
// missing, on a test network only. The faucet is a wallet of its own holding a float of test tokens,
// and it transfers from that float: it mints nothing and holds no authority or role, so the most a
// compromised server loses is the float. Key-free here: what holds the key is a sender
// (faucet/signer.ts), handed in. The rules a send is held to, whichever sender does it:
// - the chain runs on its real adapter on network `testnet`, never the mock and never mainnet;
// - what is sent is what the server read as missing for this buy, with a small margin, and never more
//   than a fixed ceiling, tight for gas, which is scarce on Robinhood Chain's test network;
// - the float covers it, with gas left for the faucet's own fee, or nothing is sent and the answer
//   says the faucet is low;
// - a person may ask a few times a day, and the faucet as a whole a few more.
// The counts are kept in memory, per process, as the other rate limits are (plugins/limits.ts).
