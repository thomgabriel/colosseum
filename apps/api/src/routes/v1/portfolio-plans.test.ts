// GET /v1/portfolio/plans (PORT-2), through HTTP on the mock chains and the real database: one entry
// for each vault of the signed-in person, with its plan, the shared portfolio it was opened to follow,
// what was put in, its newest snapshot, its status and the shared portfolio the chain shows it
// following. The orders are real ones, taken through the API. The
// snapshots and the passes of the worker are made up (testing/portfolio-world.ts): the worker is
// another app.
//
// Other sessions write to this database at the same time, so every test makes its own people and
// reads only their rows. One thing here is nobody's: a pass of the worker (`snapshot_runs`) is its
// chain's, and the route answers with the chain's newest. So:
// - This file's clock stands still, a month past the newest run the database holds on the mock chains
//   and never before 2100. The wall clock, and the made-up days of the worker's own tests (2040 to
//   2072), are long before it: no run of another file is the newest, or within a day of it.
// - A run seeded here is dropped when its test ends.
// - A run of this file holds a Postgres advisory lock from its first query to its last. Two runs on
//   one database (two worktrees, a review beside a build) wait for each other, and neither sets its
//   clock by the other's runs. The lock is the session's and goes with its connection, so a run that
//   is killed leaves none behind; a run it leaves in `snapshot_runs` is a month older than the next
//   run's clock.
