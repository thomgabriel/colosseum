The plan is made by a deterministic engine on the chain the signed-in person's plans live on (`GET /v1/me`), from the assets listed there and the shared portfolios that have a recipe there. The sheet names that one chain: another answers 422, and a person with no chain yet gets 409. Stock tokens are never in a plan whose goal is to protect or to earn an income. A line's ceiling comes from the measured exit of its token where there is one; where there is none it is its tier's, and the line and `flags` say so (`ceiling_from_tier:<asset>`). Every line has its reasons; every figure the plan stands on is in `observations` with its source, time, method and provenance. `rollUp` is the plan's concentration by issuer, chain and class and its exit figures, from the same figures; with no stored quote before a deposit, its quoted exit is null. The answer's `id` is what `POST /v1/orders` deposits into (`proposalId`). `candidates` are the plans of the same goal made three ways inside the same limits (Cover, Spread, Carry), each stored with its own `id`, in that fixed order, none marked or selected; each has its `scorecard` (months covered, months paid now and under each named stress, carry observed, exit cost, concentration, credit share, open FX for a goal not in dollars) and, with withdrawals to come, its `status` with the ways to close a gap. Two that come out as one choice, or one that another matches or betters on every line of the scorecard, are not shown: `candidatesNotShown` says why. No odds and no projected return.  `thread` carries bounded guided turns, stored privately once for the whole offered build. `previousPlanId` joins only the caller’s own prior conversation; another owner or linked plan is ignored.
