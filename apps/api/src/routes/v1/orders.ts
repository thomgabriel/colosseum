An order is on one chain: the plan's own, a vault's own, or for a shared portfolio (`family`) the chain `chain` names, which has to be one the portfolio has a recipe on and one a wallet of the person signs on (409 `NO_WALLET_FOR_CHAIN` otherwise), else the person's current chain (`GET /v1/me`). The whole amount is deposited in the chain's dollar token: `depositRaw` on the order. Each step it concerns repeats it as `cashRaw`, the approval and the step that deposits alike, so the steps' figures are not added up. For a deposit, the trades swap the invested share into the plan's assets, in its proportions, and what the plan keeps in cash stays in the vault as cash.
