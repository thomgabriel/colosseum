        description:
          'The person’s holdings added up, read from what the snapshot worker kept (`vault_snapshots`) and never from a chain: the newest snapshot of each vault of the wallets of the identity token, on every chain this server runs that the person holds a wallet for. `chain` narrows the answer to one chain, and `address` to one vault: the sums, the roll-up and the size each exit is costed at are then that vault’s alone, and an address that is not a vault of the person’s narrows the answer to nothing, never to an error. `chains` has an entry for each chain also when it holds nothing; a chain of the person’s that is switched off here is in `unavailable`, never shown as zero, and `total` then adds up only what could be read. In an entry, `valueUsd` is the sum, each position at the value its snapshot gave it and the cash at one dollar each; `byUnderlying` and `byIssuer` are that sum by what each asset stands for and by who issued it, largest first, in dollars and in basis points that add up to 10,000; `vaults` is how many vaults were counted (a vault the worker has not read yet adds nothing) and `observedAt` the oldest snapshot used, so no figure is fresher than it. A holding with no price, or one the asset list does not name, is in `unvalued` with the amount held, and in no sum. On a test network a token is counted under the issuer, and falls back to the tier, of the mainnet token it models where the server holds them, as in a plan made there. `rollUp` is the risk roll-up over the same holdings, null when the chain holds nothing; no stored quote is read, so its quoted exit is null and it says `exit_quote_missing`. `exit` has one entry for each asset in the sums that is not cash, at the whole holding (`usd`). Where the asset is measured, `measured` is true and `costBps` is the measured cost of selling that size in the worst measured time of the week, to a hundredth of a basis point, with its `source`, `method` (the version of the method that measured it), `fetchedAt` (the end of the data behind the measurement, left out where it has none) and `provenance`; it is null where the size is beyond what was measured, and where the measurement names no source or no time, so no cost goes out without them. Where it does not, `measured` is false, `fallbackTier` names the asset’s tier and `costBps` is null: a tier is a ceiling on what a plan may hold and states no cost (gate EXIT-SOURCE). `total` adds the chains up and is null when none holds anything; its `provenance` is the least live of the labels of the chains that add to it, its `source` and `method` those of the chains it adds, and `observedAt` the oldest of their snapshots. Every entry carries `provenance`: `live` is mainnet, `sandbox` a test network and `mock` a chain made up in memory (MOCK); nothing that is not `live` is to be shown as live. A call with no sign-in is refused (401). None of it is advice: see `disclaimer`.',
