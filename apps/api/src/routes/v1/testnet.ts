The server works out what is missing for this deposit itself, as GET /v1/funding does, and sends that with a small margin: test dollars and the native token for fees, transferred from the faucet’s float. Naming no plan, shared portfolio or vault is a top-up on the person’s current chain before anything is chosen: what is missing for a deposit of `amountUsd` into a new vault of up to eight holdings. Never on mainnet. A person may ask three times a day, the faucet as a whole five hundred; one send is at most $10,000 in test dollars. The faucet is a wallet holding a float of test tokens that it transfers from, with no mint authority or role; a send the float cannot cover answers 409 with `test funds are low; ask the team` (or `test gas is low; ask the team`). The answer names what was sent and the test network’s transaction ids, and nothing about the node or the key.',
