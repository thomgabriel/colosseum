Each route says under `security` whether it needs them, and under `x-rate-limit` the class of requests it is counted in. Every answer carries `ratelimit-limit`, `ratelimit-remaining` and `ratelimit-reset`; a 429 carries `retry-after` too. Every refusal has one shape, with a `code` where one fits and `details.retryable`. Every figure carries its source, its time and its method, and `provenance`: anything that is not `live` is a test network or MOCK.";
