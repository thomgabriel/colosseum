 *   one the person was last asked to sign. After a revert and a rebuild the new attempt has a nonce
 *   of its own, so the reverted one is never taken for it.
 * - The nonce is one no attempt states: an outside wallet chose its own. It is the newest attempt that
 *   can still land, or was closed without landing. A step that is already settled takes no such
 *   transaction: the same call on another nonce is another transaction. Neither does a nonce below
 *   every nonce the step's attempts state: a wallet's nonce only grows, so that transaction landed
 *   before the step was first built. It is an older call of the same wallet that happens to be the
 *   same call, an approval or a deposit made by another route, and not this step's.
