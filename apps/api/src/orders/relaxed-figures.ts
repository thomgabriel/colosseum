// The measured figures the relaxed intake may state by reference (RELAXED-INTAKE as amended
// 2026-10-09 and again 2026-10-14; the rules are FIGURES-BY-REFERENCE's, in vault-figures.ts,
// unchanged). This file only chooses which of the request's evidence the model is handed, and writes the
// served message. What the model looks up in a reply is added by the lookup loop (lookup-loop.ts).
//
// What is handed over: the figures of the holdings the conversation names, not the whole catalog's.
// A catalog of a dozen assets has about a dozen figures each, and the block varies with the
// conversation, so it cannot sit in the cached prefix; a question is about one to four holdings, and
// loading those keeps the uncached part of the prompt a few hundred tokens. A holding is named by its
// symbol, what it tracks or its company in any turn, by its id in a draft the web kept and resent, or
// by a class word ("the stocks") in the person's latest message, which loads at most `CLASS_LOADS` more
// than are named already. The others are listed by symbol only,
// so the model can say their figures come once they are named. Each id goes with what it measures, its
// value and unit, when it was measured and its provenance (RELAXED-INTAKE as amended again, 2026-10-14:
// with ids alone the wrong id was the model's likely mistake). It still writes none of them: a typed
// value is refused, and every figure is served by reference.
