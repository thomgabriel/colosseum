/**
 * The shares the person stated, read by the server from their own messages and from nothing else (gate
 * ANY-COMPOSITION). The default is not to apply: unread and said back is always acceptable, applied or
 * withdrawn wrongly is not.
 *
 * Applied: a sentence (or its side of "but" that has its own asking verb) sets shares only when it is
 * no question, condition, someone else's view or refusal and holds no return or loss word, and every
 * comma-separated piece of it is a plain ask: shares read by `sharesInPiece` with nothing before them
 * but leads, a first-person subject and one asking verb, start to end ("I want", "please put", "quero",
 * "make it"; not "You put", "I'm scared to put", "I want to reduce"), nothing between them but
 * "and", and nothing after them but "in this vault", "overall" or what the rest should do. A piece
 * that only asks ("I want EV stocks"), only says where the rest goes, or is a courtesy may stand
 * beside them. Anything else in the sentence ("70% TSLA is too risky", "Hypothetically, 70% in TSLA",
 * "Increase TSLA 10%") and none of it is applied.
 *
 * Replaced: a later share on exactly the same asset or class. A class share and an asset share stand
 * together. "Make that at least 10%" re-numbers the one share that stands.
 *
 * Withdrawn, by these whole sentences only: "forget/drop/remove [the] X [share/limit]" where X is the
 * asset or class of a standing share; "drop the minimum/maximum/limit" when exactly one such share
 * stands; and "split it equally" / "equal split" / "partes iguais".
 *
 * `standing` is what holds now and `read` everything ever read (to compare with what the model
 * reports). For the latest message: `withdrawn` the shares it withdrew, `unread` the pieces that read
 * as a share and set none, and `rest` where it said the rest should go, with the assets it named.
