// The product's bar is his landing's compact bar (compact-nav.md, hero-3d.html), compact from the
// start because no product page has a stage: the mark and the wordmark, then his items mapped to the
// product's routes, then the wallet. A solid bar with a hairline, fixed at the top; no glass, no blur.
//
//   Invest      the goal and its plan (/goal)
//   Portfolio   the person's vaults (/monitor), for someone signed in
//   Analytics   Bearing's analytics (/analytics/stocks), current on every page under /analytics,
//               its methodology too, which its side menu links (no Resources item: Thom, Oct 6)
//   the account one control, the same on the landing's bar (Thom, Oct 9; AccountControl.tsx): a still
//               placeholder until it is known who is here, "Sign in" for nobody, and for a person
//               "Account", opening their wallets (one for each chain they have one on, each with
//               "Copy address" and the explorer) and "Sign out" (AccountMenu.tsx). The bar shows and
//               switches no chain (gate CHAIN-AT-THE-PLAN): where a plan starts is chosen on /goal
//
//   Products    the shelf of shared portfolios (/shelf), and a portfolio's page under it
//
// An order's page (/orders/{id}) is under none of them: an order is a plan's deposit, a shared
// portfolio's publish, buy or follow, or a vault's change, and the page alone does not say which
// section it came from, so no item is lit there.
//
// On a phone the links are in the sheet under the menu button, under the same account block (the
// wallets, "Sign out"); the bar's control is the same "Account".
//
// Nothing here is the wallet adapter's button, which renders one thing on the server and another in
// the browser. What the bar shows about the person comes from the wallet port, and it shows nothing
// about them until the port has loaded, so the server and the browser draw the same bar.
