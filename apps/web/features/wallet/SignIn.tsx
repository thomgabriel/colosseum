// The ways in, on the primitives (GATES, SIGN-IN, SIGN-IN-FLOW, SIGN-IN-PAIR): a passkey or a wallet.
//
// The passkey side opens with a pair of equal standing (Thom, Oct 9): "Create a passkey" for someone
// new and "Use my passkey" for someone who has one, a short line under each. What a new passkey is (a
// new account with a new, empty wallet, not a way into one the person has) is the line under the button
// that makes one, there before it is pressed. Neither is made or used by the other: each is its own
// press, so the browser has a gesture for it. The one this browser can vouch for leads: once a passkey
// has signed in here, "Use my passkey" is the primary; until then nothing is known and they are equals.
//
// A prompt that the person closed, or that found no passkey, is no failure: it is said calmly, as a
// note about finding the passkey they have, and never about making one (that is the button above,
// with its warning). Red is kept for what went wrong, a refusal with no prompt behind it included.
// Where passkeys cannot be used at all the pair is off, with the reason said once.
//
// The wallet side is the list of the wallets found in this browser, one entry per wallet with its own
// name and icon and, under the name, where a plan made with it lives; under it a quiet disclosure
// says what to do about a wallet that is not listed (it connects nothing, and is not drawn as one). A wallet that signs on both families asks first which chain
// the plan lives on, since that is the family it signs in with. Nothing of the wallet provider's is
// drawn: its hooks run behind `signIn()` of the wallet port. No spinner: a busy button changes its
// label, and a wait over 400ms shows the loader with its words. A failure is a sentence that says what
// to do, never what the wallet or the provider threw.
