// The three typefaces of the design system (token-mapping.md, section 5; gate IDENTITY-2), from files
// committed with the app (assets/fonts, each under the SIL Open Font License beside it):
// `next/font/local` serves them from this origin, and a build fetches nothing, so it cannot fail for
// want of Google's servers. They are the files Google Fonts serves for the Latin subset: Inter Tight
// (one variable file, weights 100 to 900; the display face, set at 600), Inter (one variable file with
// its optical-size axis; the UI face, 400 to 600) and, in fonts-mono.ts, IBM Plex Mono 400 and 500.
// Each face comes with a fallback whose metrics are adjusted to match it, so text does not move when
// the real face arrives: the fallbacks are written in globals.css with the figures next/font works out
// for these faces (capsize's average widths against Arial's).
//
// The display and the UI face are preloaded on every route whose layout imports this file: the product
// shell and the landing, where they set the first thing a person reads. The mono face lives in
// fonts-mono.ts and is not preloaded.
//
// There is no condensed face and no serif (IDENTITY-2): `--font-condensed` is Inter Tight. The Latin
// files hold no Greek, so the "τ" and "Σ" Bearing writes in its methods are drawn by the system's face.

// The loader takes its options as written values only, so each file's range of characters is written
// where it is used: the range is the one Google's stylesheet lists for the Latin files.
//
// `next/font/local` would name each face after its export (`inter`). Each is told its own name
// instead (`declarations`, `font-family`), so the stylesheet says Inter Tight, Inter and IBM Plex Mono;
// the variable the loader writes still starts with its own name, which is no face, so the real name
// and the fallback follow it (`fallback`).
