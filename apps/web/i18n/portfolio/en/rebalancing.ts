// The rebalancing page (/portfolio/rebalancing), in English: the steps that traded in a person's

// answers and no more: a step of the person's own carries a quote, never what the trade paid, and a
// trade of the keeper's is worked out from two snapshots. From "The portfolio section's routes" in
// DESIGN-VAULT section 3.3: keep the two in step.
