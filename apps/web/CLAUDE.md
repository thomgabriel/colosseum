## Screens follow the design system

`.design/branding/working-brand/patterns/STYLE.md` is binding, with the component specs in `patterns/components/`. A screen that breaks one of these is wrong, however good it looks:

1. A provenance pin after every yield, price and FX figure. No pin, no number.
2. MOCK is never shown as live: one quiet tag in the top-right corner of a card that holds figures ("Sample figures" or "Test network") and a hatched glyph or pin named "sample figure" on a figure; no boxed word MOCK, no hatched card edge (gate `MOCK-QUIET`). Text never sits on the hatch. The line of the card with an order's steps on a test network reads "Test network · <chain> · not live" (gate `BUY-STEPS`).
3. The disclaimer renders from the one `DISCLAIMER` constant, unedited, at body size.
4. No Japanese words or clichés in the product.
5. Nothing that looks like Teiten.
6. One brand colour, honey `#F5A83A`, with ink text on it in both modes (gate `IDENTITY-2`, Rodrigo, Oct 8). Status is a word plus a shape plus leaf, clay or madder on a 14% tint; deltas are signed and coloured by direction. Chalk `#78B4E8` / `#2A73B0` is a line only (the focus ring, guides, \"today\"); no other blue, no violet. Verified token identification logos retain their native artwork colours (Thom, Oct 7, INVEST-TWO-PANE); the interface and chart palette remain unchanged, except that what a vault holds takes the share palette, drawn by `<Composition>` (gate `WEIGHTS-RING`, Thom, Oct 13).
7. The brand recedes in the partner embed.

Soft, not square (gate `IDENTITY-2`): cards 10px, buttons, inputs and popovers 8px, tags 6px, chips and status badges pills, no shadows except popovers; the typing box stays 20px with its round send button. Token identification icons use a circular AssetMark wrapper (Thom, Oct 7). Headings and big numbers in Inter Tight 600, UI in Inter, provenance in IBM Plex Mono; no serif. Light and dark both ship. One primary button per view; a button that signs names the action and the amount. No spinners: a busy button changes its label.

Copy follows `.design/branding/working-brand/strategy/voice-and-tone.md`: answer, then reason, then risk, then action; "I" for the agent; sentence case; no exclamation marks; MOCK is the only uppercase word.
