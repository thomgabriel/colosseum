// The worker's passes on packages/chain-mock and a real Postgres (DATABASE_URL; `pnpm db:up`).
//
// EVERY test of the worker that touches the database is in this one file. `snapshot_runs` allows one
// open run per chain, and vitest runs files side by side: two files opening runs on one chain would
// trip each other, each seeing the other's run as another worker's. Inside a file the tests run one
// after another.
//
// Two runs of this file on one database would trip each other the same way: two worktrees, or a
// review beside a build, share the local database. So the file holds a Postgres advisory lock from
// its first query to its last, and a second run waits at its start until the first is done. The
// lock is the session's and goes with its connection, so a run that is killed leaves none behind.
// What a killed run can leave is an open run stamped in its made-up days. A worker already running
// on the same database never takes that one for left open, since its start is not in the past, and
// skips the chain: the next run of this file, or the next start of the worker, closes it.
//
// Other test files share this database. Their `vaults` rows and owners turn up in these passes as
// `skipped` lines (no such vault on this file's own mock), so every assertion here is on this
// file's own vaults: their owners are new at each run, and so are their addresses. The worker's
// clock is given four made-up days far from any real row, three hours of them to each test, which
// is how this file's runs are told apart and taken away at the end.
