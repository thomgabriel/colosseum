# Exit-plan line
> Type: custom | Component: `<ExitPlanLine>` (and `<ExitPlanPanel>` for the plan view) | Glyph: J3 dovetail drop

Every portfolio states how money comes back out **before** the agent invests: how much, how fast, at what cost. The line is the compact form (cards, showcase, simulator); the panel is the full form ("Access to cash" on the plan view).

## Anatomy: line

```
┃ ⟂ Exit plan · up to $4,000 within a day · the rest within 7 days · cost ≤ 0.50% ⊡
┃   Weekend exits are slower and cost more.
```

- 2px left rule in `--primary` (hardwood / hinoki), 12px left padding. (The landing prototype's `.exitline` pattern, kept.)
- J3 glyph 16px (`--muted-foreground`), then "Exit plan" (Plex Sans 500), then the tiers separated by " · " (Plex Sans 400 `text-body-sm`, tabular). Any cost or price carries a [pin](./provenance-pin.md); costs are estimates from the engine/Bearing, labelled "≤" or "about", never exact promises.
- Optional second line: the caveat, `--muted-foreground`.

## Anatomy: panel (plan view)

Card with header "Access to cash" + J3 24px. Body: a short orthographic **dimension line** per tier (dashed, because it's projected): `today ├──── $4,000 ────┤ 1 day ├──── $8,480 ────┤ 7 days`, Plex Mono values with 45° ticks. Below it a table: tier · amount · time · estimated cost ⊡ · route (e.g. "redeem USDY", "sell on Jupiter at the thinnest hour, Bearing v1.3"). For equity legs (non-income only), the time and cost come from Bearing's measured depth, with its `method` in the pin.

## States

| State | Treatment |
|---|---|
| Measured | dimension line dashed (projected), values with live pins |
| Partly mock | the mocked tier gets a hatch band + MOCK plate; others normal |
| Not yet sourced (landing / simulator) | the line reads "Yields and exit costs are sourced live after you connect." in muted text; no numbers without a source |
| Breach (a stress case breaks the window) | notched madder square + "Off track: in the rate-shock case, cash within 7 days drops to $2,100." |
| Watch | half ochre square + word + reason |

## Rules

- No `LogOut`, `DoorOpen` or parachute icons: exit is designed, not escaped.
- Never phrase as a guarantee ("guaranteed liquidity", "instant withdrawal"). Use "up to", "within", "about", "estimated".
- Dashed = projected. The dimension lines are dashed; realised exits in the activity log are solid.

## Accessibility

The dimension drawing is `aria-hidden`; the tier table/sentence carries the content. Left rule is decorative (meaning is in the text "Exit plan"). Contrast: body text ink/washi; rule hardwood 5.57 / hinoki 13.44.

## Do / don't

| Do | Don't |
|---|---|
| "up to $4,000 within a day · cost ≤ 0.50% ⊡" | "Withdraw anytime!" |
| State the exit before the invest button | Hide the exit plan in a tab or footnote |
