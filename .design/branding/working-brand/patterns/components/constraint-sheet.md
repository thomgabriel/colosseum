# Constraint sheet (editable)
> Type: custom | Component: `<ConstraintSheet mode="edit" | "read">` | Replaces: the 11-field `field()` grid in GoalFlow and the raw `dl` in PlanView | Revised 2026-10-08 (honey on night)

The LLM reads a goal into a typed sheet, asking where the goal is unclear and saying back what it understood (gate `GUIDED-INTAKE`); it never decides the plan. The person sees exactly what was read, can change any field, and **the solver never runs on a sheet that failed zod validation**. This component is where that rule becomes visible.

## Anatomy (edit mode)

- Wrapper: [card](./card.md) (`rounded-lg p-6`), fields grouped in `<fieldset>` with `<legend>` (Inter 500 caption, 12px uppercase +0.04em, muted) and a 1px `--border` rule.
- Fields: [field.md](./field.md). Human labels and option names (`monthly_cashflow` → "Monthly income", `accept_fx` → "Accept FX risk"); the schema key is available in a `title`/dev tooltip only.
- Fields changed by the person vs the parser get the "edited" marker (6px honey square + "edited").
- Source line: `parser: {method} ({model}) · fetched_at` in Plex Mono muted. If the parser was a fixture or mock, this source line carries the hatched sample glyph and reads "Sample reading · parser fixture" in muted, no box ([mock-plate.md](./mock-plate.md), gate MOCK-QUIET).

## Validation states

| State | What the person sees | Primary button |
|---|---|---|
| **Valid** | no summary; fields at rest | "Build my plan" enabled (honey, ink) |
| **Invalid** (zod `issues`) | summary box at top: `bg-madder-tint` fill, 1px `--destructive` border, 8px radius, notched-square glyph + "N things don't fit yet." Each issue = field label + a sentence saying what to change + "Go to field" link. Each field: `aria-invalid`, madder border, its sentence under it | `aria-disabled="true"` (fill `--muted`, text `--muted-foreground`), label stays "Build my plan", hint: "Fix the 2 fields above to continue." Clicking it moves focus to the summary. **No request is sent to `/plans`** |
| **Server rejected** (API returns 400 with issues) | same as invalid, mapped from `issues[].path` | same; the server is the final gate, the UI is the first |
| **Parsing** | composer busy; sheet area shows the 3-segment honey loader + "Reading your goal…" | hidden |
| **Solving** | sheet becomes read-only (`fieldset disabled` semantics with readable text), button busy "Building your plan…", `role="status"` | busy |
| **Solver error** (valid sheet, no feasible plan) | a card under the sheet: "No plan fits these limits." + which constraint binds + "Edit sheet". Not styled as a validation error (no madder tint) | rest |

Error copy rules: say what to change, never blame, sentence case, no exclamation marks, no raw zod text ("Expected number, received nan" → "Enter an amount in reais."). Validation messages live in a copy dictionary keyed by `issues[].path` + `code`, in the sheet's `language`.

## Read mode (PlanView)

A `<dl>` grid of the same human labels and formatted values, no wells (read-only field style), with "Edit sheet" (secondary, 8px, line-l2 / line-2 edge) that returns to GoalFlow with the sheet prefilled. A new solve creates a new plan; the old one is kept.

## Product rules surfaced here

- **xStocks never in income**: when Profile = Income, the sheet shows a caption under Profile: "Income plans don't include tokenized stocks." This is informational; enforcement is in the asset registry.
- No yield, price or APY appears on the sheet: it holds limits, not outcomes, so it carries no pins. If a future field shows a rate (e.g. an FX reference), it gets a pin.
- The disclaimer is not on the sheet; it's under the plan ([disclaimer-block](./disclaimer-block.md)).

## Accessibility (WCAG 2.2 AA)

- 3.3.1 / 3.3.3: errors identified in text, with suggestions. 3.3.4 not applicable (no transaction here); signing has its own confirm.
- On failed submit, focus moves to the summary (`tabIndex={-1}`); each item links to its field (`href="#field-id"`).
- 3.3.7 Redundant entry: the original goal text and all edits persist when going back.
- 2.4.6: fieldset legends group related controls. Target size ≥ 24px for selects (40px tall). Focus is the 2px chalk ring everywhere.
- Contrast: madder-l 6.08 on white and 5.19 on its tint (the glyph and the sentence carry it); madder 5.52 on night-2.

## Code hint

```tsx
const result = ConstraintSheet.safeParse(draft);
const issues = result.success ? [] : result.error.issues;
<Button variant="primary" aria-disabled={!result.success || busy}
  onClick={() => (result.success ? solve(result.data) : summaryRef.current?.focus())}>
  Build my plan
</Button>
```

`solve()` accepts only `ConstraintSheet` (the parsed type), so an unvalidated draft cannot reach it by type.

## Do / don't

| Do | Don't |
|---|---|
| Show the parser's reading and let every field be edited | Hide the sheet and go straight to a plan |
| Block the solve on invalid input and say why | Let the solver "best-effort" an invalid sheet |
| "Monthly income" | `target.kind: monthly_cashflow` |
| A madder-tinted summary with a notched square | A red banner with an exclamation mark |
