# Goal showcase case (marketing)
> Type: custom | Component: `<ShowcaseCase>` | Source: landing prototype `.case` (Mariana / trip fund, Diego / mountain season) | Revised 2026-10-08 (honey on night)

> **Superseded on the landing (2026-10-08, gate `LANDING-HERO`, Rodrigo):** `/` is the hero alone, with the honey fog behind it; this component is no longer built. Kept as the record of the design.

A sample person, their goal in their own words, and the plan cut for it: the plan drawn as a joint + prompt + plan panel (sheet chips, KPIs, chart, legs, exit line) + the sample marking. It shows *the same pieces fit differently for different people*. **Everything in it is sample.**

Grid: 5 / 7 columns (≥ 980px), stacked below. One case per row, 32px between cases.

## Parts

1. **Plan column** (gate `PLAN-JOINT`): the case's plan drawn as a joint in the hero's ink (`JOINT-3D`), not a photograph: one post stacked from the plan's parts, each layer as tall as its share and drawn in the part's legend colour (`--chart-1`…`4`), each set on the one below by a tenon whose hidden length is dashed, with a hairline reveal at each joint; a leader from each layer to its share and name in Plex Mono, in one aligned column kept inside the drawing; a long name wraps at a word, never smaller than 12 px on a phone. Outline 1.5 px, other lines 0.85 px. Its parts are read from the same case data as the legend and the chart. The layers come together from a little apart (≈ 1 s) when the card comes into view; never with reduced motion. Each layer is a part the reader can point at (Thom, Oct 6): a mouse over it, a tap, or the keyboard (one tab stop; the arrows step through the layers; Escape lets go) lifts it a few pixels out of the stack, brightens it and dims the rest, and lights the same part in the parts list and in the trip chart's bars; a row of the list lights its layer. With reduced motion only the colours change. No caption. **The prompt sits on a solid plate above the drawing**, not on it: `who` line (Plex Mono 12px, `--primary`) + the quote (Newsreader 400, 20–23px, typographic quotes). This is the case's one serif line.
2. **Pane head**: title (Inter 600 18px), sub-line muted, the case keeps a 6px hatched left edge (frame placement); no badge (gate MOCK-QUIET).
3. **Sheet chips**: the constraint sheet in compact form, `key: value`, Plex Mono 12px, `bg-muted`, 1px `--border`, **6px radius** (tags, not pills: they are not interactive). Not interactive.
4. **KPI strip**: [card.md](./card.md) stat cells joined by hairlines; values in Inter Tight 600 (`text-figure-lg` at ≥ 980px, `text-b-kpi` below); 4 columns, 2×2 below 620px. Rates, prices and anything derived from yields ("earned on top") carry a hatched pin; estimates say "estimate" in the unit slot. Odds are labelled "estimate", never "chance to win".
5. **Chart**: SVG, `currentColor` + tokens. Base case honey 2px with `curve-fill` beneath (solid = base/measured); payouts, stresses and range edges dashed in `--muted-foreground` / `--destructive`; the target line dashed `--foreground`; "today" a dashed chalk line with a Plex Mono label. Direct labels at line ends. `role="img"` + `aria-label` summary, plus a visually hidden data table.
6. **Legs**: [plan-leg.md](./plan-leg.md) in label-list form (weight + why), honey family + one neutral.
7. **Exit line**: [exit-plan-line.md](./exit-plan-line.md), with "Sourced live after you connect." in muted.
8. **Pane foot**: hairline top; "sample rates, not live" + hatched pin glyph; `DISCLAIMER_SHORT` on the right. The full [disclaimer block](./disclaimer-block.md) sits once below the showcase section.

## Data rules

- All figures come from `fixtures/showcase/*.json` with `"provenance": "mock"` and `source`/`fetched_at`/`method` fields (e.g. `source: "sample"`, `method: "illustrative weights v1"`). **No rate literals in components** (the prototype's in-script `sampleRate` values move to fixtures; the repo's yield-literal test enforces this).
- **Income cases never include tokenized stocks (xStocks).** The Mariana case (income) has no equity leg, and its sub-line says so. Only growth/high-risk cases (Diego) may show xStocks, sized to Analytics.
- The showcase never claims returns: "earned on top" is labelled sample; no "earn up to".

## Prototype deltas (the `.yml` wins)

| Prototype | Spec |
|---|---|
| Prompt text on the photo over a `linear-gradient` scrim | Prompt on a solid plate below the drawing (no text over the picture, no gradient scrims) |
| `photo-src` label overlaid on the photo | No photograph: the plan drawn as a joint, no caption |
| `filter: saturate(.9) contrast(1.02)` on the photo | No photograph, so no filter |
| `.mock` = text on hatch with a background span | The case's hatched edge + the muted foot line "sample rates, not live" ([mock-plate.md](./mock-plate.md), gate MOCK-QUIET) |
| `.pin` = 7px hatched circle | The square-pin glyph in its sample state (hatched, no pin, "sample figure") |
| Eyebrow "TWO GOALS · TWO CUTS" uppercase | A caption eyebrow (12px uppercase is allowed for eyebrows) or sentence case Plex Mono; no all-caps word in running text |
| Serif prompt quote | Inter Tight 600 |
| Brown wood legs | Honey-family legs with 2px gaps and pill ends |
| Legend swatches beside the chart | Direct labels at line ends + the leg list |
| "Simulation. Not investment advice." | `DISCLAIMER_SHORT` here + full `DISCLAIMER` block under the section |
| Dark only | Light ships too (paper ground, white case) |

## Accessibility

`<article aria-labelledby>` per case; the drawing's label names each part and its share, as the legend does; chart has text alternative; KPI values in text. Contrast: all text ≥ 4.5 on `--card` in both modes (ink 18.05 on white, text 16.15 on night-2; muted-l 5.39, muted 6.77); the honey base-case line is 1.99 on white and 9.16 on night-2, so on light the chart's data are also in the hidden table and the direct labels are in `--foreground`.

## Do / don't

| Do | Don't |
|---|---|
| A hatched edge and "sample rates, not live" on every case, hatched pins on every rate | One "sample data" note at the bottom of the page |
| Prompt in the person's words, Inter Tight, on a solid plate | Overlaying text on the drawing |
| Rates from fixtures with provenance | Rates typed into the JSX |
